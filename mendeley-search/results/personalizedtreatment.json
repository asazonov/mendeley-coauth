        "abstract": "This chapter aims to outline a flexible framework which the dental team can use to bring together key elements of information about their patients and their patients' teeth in order to plan appropriate, patient-centred, caries management based on the application of best current evidence and practice. This framework can be enabled by the use of the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) clinical visual scoring systems for caries detection and activity, but also needs additional information about lesions and the patient to plan and then monitor the effectiveness of personalized caries care. The treatment planning process has evolved from restorative treatment decisions being largely made during clinical assessment as an examination of wet teeth proceeds, with limited charting and a minor role for patient factors. Best practice now involves a comprehensive examination being made systematically of clean dry teeth using sharp eyes and blunt probes. The ICDAS-enabled framework provides for information to be collected at the tooth/surface level (clinical visual lesion detection, lesion detection aids and lesion activity assessment) and at the patient level (patient caries risk assessment, dentition and lesion history and patient behavioural assessment). This information is then synthesized to inform integrated, personalized treatment planning which involves the choice of appropriate treatment options (background level care, preventive treatment options, operative treatment options) and then recall, reassessment and monitoring. Examples of international moves towards using integrated, personalized treatment planning for caries control are given, drawing on experiences in the UK, the USA and from the ICDAS Committee.",

        "abstract": "Personalized treatment of uveal melanoma involves the tailoring of all aspects of care to the condition, needs, wishes, and fears of the patient, taking account of the individual's circumstances. When selecting between radiotherapy, surgical resection, and phototherapy, or when deciding how best to combine these different therapeutic modalities, it is necessary to understand the patients utilities, with respect to tumour control, visual conservation, and preservation of the eye, so as to prioritize outcomes accordingly. For example, such considerations would influence the width of the safety margins when administering radiotherapy, according to whether the patient considers it more important to conserve vision or to guarantee tumour control. With 'suspicious naevi', the choice between observation, immediate treatment, and biopsy is complicated by the lack of adequate survival data on which to base rational decisions, making it necessary for both patient and doctor to accept uncertainty. Personalized care should involve close relatives, as appropriate. It must also adapt to changes in the patient's needs over time. Such personalized care demands the ability to respond to such needs and the sensitivity to identify these requirements in the first place. Personalized treatment enhances not only the patient's satisfaction but also the 'job satisfaction' of all members of the multidisciplinary team, improving quality of care.",

        "abstract": "Lymphoma comprises two groups of diseases: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Within both subsets are numerous variations with distinct biologic, molecular, and cytogenetic characteristics. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of NHL, for example, now identifies several dozen broad entities and nearly 60 unique clinicopathologic subtypes. In addition to pathologic heterogeneity, there is clinical diversity within lymphomas, with some patients achieving cure, others having prolonged disease stabilization, and still others experiencing a rapidly fulminant decline and death. It is increasingly appreciated that both clinical and biological features strongly influence outcome. Practical implementation of a personalized approach to treatment is urgently needed, but efforts thus far have focused primarily on prognostication, with much less emphasis on determining therapeutic options. Nevertheless, better prognostic tools will facilitate the design of \"risk-stratified\" trials that will ultimately benefit patients. Thus far, the development of personalized treatment in lymphomas clusters into several broad approaches: refinement of clinical prognostic models for better risk stratification, use of high-throughput technology to identify biologic subtypes within pathologically similar diseases, \"response-adapted\" changes in therapy via imaging with [ 18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and anti-idiotype vaccines. An important unmet need is the implementation of these tools into treatment choices for individual patients, and this is the focus of intense ongoing research. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To establish personalized treatment of osteoporosis. METHODS: A T869-->C polymorphism in exon 1 of the transforming growth factor-beta1 gene, which results in a Leu-->Pro substitution at amino acid 10, is reported to be associated with the rate of bone loss as well as the response to active vitamin D treatment. Therefore, we determined this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to estimate the need of active vitamin D treatment. We also determined serum level of 25 hydroxy-vitamin D to evaluate a degree of vitamin D fulfillment. Based on these data, we categorized postmenopausal patients into four groups; C homozygote with vitamin D deficiency patients to whom 1 microg/day active vitamin D was administered, C homozygote without vitamin D deficiency patients or those who bore at least one T-allele with vitamin D deficiency to whom 0.5 microg/day active vitamin D was administered, and patients who bore at least one T-allele without vitamin D deficiency to whom no drug was given. The patients were checked up every 6 months with regard to changes in bone mineral density and occurrence of fresh fractures. RESULTS: The SNP was associated with prevalent vertebral fractures; the frequency of the T allele was significantly greater in patients with vertebral fractures. Furthermore, the serum level of 25 hydroxy-vitamin D was significantly lower in patients with vertebral fractures, which were observed in 17 out of 34 patients who bore at least one T-allele as well as vitamin D deficiency, while only 2 of 15 homozygous C-allele carriers without vitamin D deficiency suffered from fractures. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the SNP in combination with the serum level of 25 hydroxy-vitamin D can predict fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

Although considerable efforts to delineate the underlying pathophysiological pathways have been undertaken during the last decades, only very limited progress on diagnostic and treatment algorithms have been achieved. High hopes have been put into genetics research to elucidate the pathogenesis of mood disorders, but so far, only small and inconsistent associations could be reported. Epidemiologic and family studies have always emphasized the importance of environmental factors; especially the impact of childhood trauma in mood disorders and more recently a number of specific gene-environment interactions have been reported. It is thus likely that the combination of a patients life history and genetic susceptibility as well as other laboratory markers might provide a better insight into mental diseases and their treatment options.

There is ongoing research to identify bioactive molecules that contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma, and many of these have been identified as potential therapeutic targets to improve control of this disease. As a consequence of these efforts, monoclonal antibodies have been developed and tested as to their effectiveness in the treatment of asthma. The assessment of these new treatments has identified particular pathways that, in selected patients, have shown benefit. The following review will discuss the current and future use of biological agents for the treatment of asthma, their efficacy, and how certain patient phenotypes and endotypes may be associated with biomarkers that may be used to select treatments to achieve greatest effectiveness of their use.

T2DM patients are often treated with more than one drug, including oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) and drugs used to treat diabetic complications, such as dyslipidemia and hypertension. If genetic testing could be employed to predict treatment outcome, appropriate measures could be taken to treat T2DM more efficiently. Here we provide a review of pharmacogenetic studies focused on OAD and a role of common drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME) and drug-transporters (DT) variants in therapy outcomes. For example, genetic variations of several membrane transporters, including SLC2A1/2 and SLC47A1/2 genes, are implicated in the highly variable glycemic response to metformin, a first-line drug used to treat newly diagnosed T2DM. Furthermore, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are implicated in variation of sulphonylurea and meglitinide metabolism. Additional variants related to drug target and diabetes risk genes have been also linked to interindividual differences in the efficacy and toxicity of OAD. Thus, in addition to promoting safe and cost-effective individualized diabetes treatment, pharmacogenomics has a great potential to complement current efforts to optimize treatment of diabetes and lead towards its effective and personalized care.",

The most frequent copy number alterations identified were: amplification of the CDK4 oncogene (5 of 28; 17.9%) and deletion of the CDKN2A (4 of 28; 14.3%) and CDKN2B (3 of 28; 10.7%) tumor suppressor genes. Amplifications of FGFR1, FGF9, or FRS2 were discovered in three subjects (10.7%). Associated alterations were: deletions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B with ATM mutations, and TP53 mutations with CTNNB1 mutations.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: No simple targetable molecular event emerged. Drugs targeting the cell cycle could be the most relevant new therapeutic approach for patients with advanced ACC. Inhibitors of the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway could also be a therapeutic option in a subset of patients, whereas other targeted therapies should be considered on a case-by-case basis.",

Genomic studies have proposed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species may play a role in clinical radiosensitivity. Additional research examining the association between genetic variants and radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis may spur the development of targeted therapy in radiation oncology, which could increase cure rates and limit toxicity. As more people become long-term cancer survivors, oncology nurses must aggressively assess and manage late treatment side effects to optimize patient functioning and quality of life.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by generalized immune suppression and increased susceptibility to infections and secondary malignancies. Malignant plasma cells (PCs) modulate the bone marrow microenvironment to favor their own survival and proliferation. These events lead to a severe deregulation of immune effectors. Extensive studies have been conducted to unveil the mechanisms through which MM cells negatively modulate immunity and to develop therapeutical approaches for restoring an efficient anti-MM immune response. AREAS COVERED: This review article covers both the immunosuppressive effects exerted by MM and the immunomodulatory potential of novel anti-MM agents. A brief overview on the most promising immunotherapeutic approaches in the field is also provided. EXPERT OPINION: MM leads to a progressive impairment of the immune system. Different approaches have been evaluated or are currently under investigation to boost a specific anti-MM immune response. The discovery that anti-MM agents like bortezomib also retain immunomodulatory properties provides evidence to support the development of combined treatment modalities. In the next future, immunotherapy will be likely included in selective treatments in early stages or in the post-transplantation setting with non toxic modalities that control or clear the neoplastic clone.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (HP) is known to be a causative bacterium of gastritis and peptic ulcers. The combination treatment consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin and clarithromycin (CAM) is widely used in eradication therapy, but the eradication fails in some patients. The main causes are CAM resistance of HP and individual variability in PPI metabolism related to the activity of the cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme. In this study, we examined the usefulness of the prediction of the pharmacotherapeutic efficacy using a newly developed analysis system for HP CAM resistance and CYP2C19 genotypes. After obtaining the informed consent from 45 subjects with HP-positive peptic ulcers, biopsy specimens of the gastric mucosa were obtained by endoscopy. HP DNA extracted from the gastric mucosa was examined by the SELMAP-PCR method, the direct sequencing method or the single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) method. HP detection rates by culture and the SELMAP-PCR method were 71% and 100%, respectively. Among 32 cultured HP, CAM resistance was confirmed in 6 samples by the in vitro drug susceptibility test. CAM-resistant gene mutations were also examined by the SELMAP-PCR method using 32 DNAs from cultured HP and the results were consistent with the drug susceptibility test. Among 22 patients, the eradication rate was 77%. Among 4 patients with CAM resistance determined by both the in vitro drug susceptibility test and the SNuPE method, eradication was successful in one intermediate metabolizer (IM), but not in three extensive metabolizers (EMs). Patients were divided into three groups according to their CYP2C19 phenotype: EMs, IMs and poor metabolizers (PMs). The eradication rates for 6 EMs, 12 IMs and 4 PMs were 33.3%, 91.7% and 100%, respectively. Based on these results, the information on CAM resistance in HP and CYP2C19 phenotypes in carriers could predict the pharmacotherapeutic efficacy and probability of eradication. It can then be possible to vary the dosing or to select another drug by the prediction of the pharmacotherapeutic efficacy.",

However, further improvements in patient outcomes may be gained by the development of predictive biomarkers in order to select individuals who are most likely to benefit from treatment, thus personalizing treatment. Using the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, we discuss the existing and potential predictive biomarkers in clinical development for use with EGFR-targeted agents in metastatic CRC. The data and technological issues surrounding such biomarkers as expression of EGFR or its family members or ligands, KRAS-, NRAS-, and BRAF-mutation status, PI3K/PTEN expression, and imaging and clinical biomarkers, such as rash and hypomagnesemia, are summarized.

        "abstract": "The yield of the cancer genome project is providing extraordi nary potential for the identification of new drug targets, for selecting individuals for specific therapies, and for predicting the outcome of an individu al with cancer. For a number of malignancies affecting the head and neck region, e.g. melanoma, lymphom a and sarcoma, we are already using genetic knowledge to select patien ts for specific targeted therapies. One example is the use of vemurafenib for patients with melanoma that harbors a BRAF mutation. For the majority of squamous cells carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC), genetic knowledge has not yet resulted in stratified approaches to therapy. Apart from site classification, SCCHN can also be grouped into those with p53 mutations (the vast majority of smoking and alcohol-induced tumors) and those harboring human papilloma virus (mainly HPV-16). HPV+ HNSCC is an emerging disease representing a distinct clinical and epidemiolo gical entity. Understanding the genetic basis of both HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC could allow therapeutic targeting of affected pathways for a stratified medicine approach. Recent gene sequenci ng studies indicate that various mutations within the PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway are found in both subgrou ps. E.g. PIK3CA mutation or amplification, and PTEN inactivation by gene copy loss or mutation are present in over 50% of oropharyngeal SCC, suggesting that targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway might be an attractive approach in these patients. Other receptor tyrosine kinase mutations occurring at low frequency e.gs FGFR1, FGFR3 and EGFR could be use to select patients for targeted therapies against these proteins, should they be established as driver mutations in these tumors. One significant challenge of targeted therapies based on gene sequenci ng informa -tion is the observation of intra-tumor genetic heterogenei ty. Because HNSCC are often readily accessible to multiple biopsies, this is an area where knowledge gained from HNSCC could be exploited to other solid tumors. Another area of significant interest is the use of immune therapy, e.g. anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA 4 antibodi es to treat solid tumors. Bio-markers predicting which patients will respond to these approaches are in develop ment. Although surgery, chemoth erapy or chemo-radiotherapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for most HNSCC in the foreseeable future, the introduction of molecular targeted therapies and immune therapies will play an ever more important role in the future manage ment of HNSCC.",

MMR deficiency not only contributes to the pathogenesis of a large proportion of CRC, but also determines the response to many of the drugs that are frequently used to treat this disease. In this Review we describe the MMR deficient phenotype and discuss how a deficiency in this DNA repair process may impact on the management of CRC, including surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and the choice of systemic agents for the palliation of advanced disease.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has been established the comprehensive genomic abnormalities of GBM, which sub-classified GBMs into 4 different molecular subtypes. The molecular subtypes could be utilized to develop personalized treatment strategy for each subtype. We applied a classifying method, NTP (Nearest Template Prediction) method to determine molecular subtype of each GBM patient and corresponding orthotopic xenograft animal model. The models were derived from GBM cells dissociated from patient's surgical sample. Specific drug candidates for each subtype were selected using an integrated pharmacological network database (PharmDB), which link drugs with subtype specific genes. Treatment effects of the drug candidates were determined by in vitro limiting dilution assay using patient-derived GBM cells primarily cultured from orthotopic xenograft tumors. The consistent identification of molecular subtype by the NTP method was validated using TCGA database. When subtypes were determined by the NTP method, orthotopic xenograft animal models faithfully maintained the molecular subtypes of parental tumors. Subtype specific drugs not only showed significant inhibition effects on the in vitro clonogenicity of patient-derived GBM cells but also synergistically reversed temozolomide resistance of MGMT-unmethylated patient-derived GBM cells. However, inhibitory effects on the clonogenicity were not totally subtype-specific. Personalized treatment approach based on genetic characteristics of each GBM could make better treatment outcomes of GBMs, although more sophisticated classifying techniques and subtype specific drugs need to be further elucidated.",

Globally the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise and is more pronounced in countries with large populations such as China, India and USA. Driving forces behind the epidemic are obesity, aging of the population and longer life expency. Prospective, the majority of diabetic population will be in their six to eight decades of life with the implication of more females than males. Severe micro- and macrovascular complications associated with diabetes lead to a highly increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, DM is projected to be one of the leading health problems of 21st centuary. Urgent measures are required to reduce the diabetic burden. Thus advanced predictive diagnostic tools and personalized treatment strategies in (pre)diabetic care are critical and should exert beneficial impact on public health.",

Determination of biomarker status after biopsy is important as not all patients are eligible for open tumor resection. We developed and validated prospectively (6/10-12/11) a protocol allowing for both reliable determination of multiple biomarkers and representative histological diagnoses from small-sized biopsies.\\n\\nMETHODS: All molecular stereotactic biopsies were performed according to a detailed workflow. The selection of specimens best suited for molecular analyses was intra-operatively guided by the attending neuropathologist. Postoperative screening was done by methylation specific PCR using two distinct cryopreserved specimens to test for reproducibility of the findings and to rule out contamination. The DNA of a single best-suited specimen (1\u00a0mm(3)) was subjected to detailed molecular analysis (MGMT promoter methylation, IDH1/2 mutational status, LOH 1p and/or 19q).\\n\\nRESULTS: 159 consecutively enrolled untreated gliomas were analyzed (94 glioblastomas, 2 gliosarcomas, 24 anaplastic astrocytomas, 10 oligo-tumors grade II/III, 20 grade II astrocytomas and 9 pilocytic astrocytomas). Transient morbidity was 2\u00a0%. Overall, the drop-out rate due to tissue contamination was 0.4\u00a0%. Median time from biopsy to histological and molecular genetic analyses was 3 and 5\u00a0days, respectively. Distributions of the respective biomarker status for tumor subgroups were consistent with the literature. The final histological diagnosis was changed/modified in 5/159 patients according to molecular findings. Treatment after molecular biopsy was highly personalized.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Molecular stereotactic biopsy is feasible and safe, can be implemented in daily clinical practice, improves diagnostic precision and enables personalized treatment.",

        "abstract": "In a personalized treatment designed for a patient with pancreatic cancer resistant to other treatments, the success of Mitomycin C (MMC) has been highlighted. This was revealed in a murine xenograft tumor model encompassing pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells extracted from the patient. The patient was found to exhibit a biallelic inactivation of the PALB2 gene, involved in DNA repair in addition to another mutation in the TSC2 gene that induces susceptibility of the tumor to therapeutic targets of the PI3K-mTOR pathway. The aim of the study was to apply metabolomics to elucidate the modes of action of each therapy, suggesting why MMC was so successful in this patient and why it could be a more popular choice in future pancreatic cancer treatment. The effectiveness of MMC compared to rapamycin (RM), another relevant therapeutic agent has been evaluated through liquid- and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses of the xenograft tumors. The relative concentrations of many metabolites in the xenograft tumors were found to be increased by MMC relative to other treatments (RM and a combination of both), including a number that are involved in central carbon metabolism (CCM). Metabolic fingerprinting revealed statistically significantly altered pathways including, but not restricted to, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, TCA cycle, purine metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, in addition to many significant lipid and amino acid alterations. Given the genetic background of the patient, it was expected that the combined therapy would be most effective; however, the most effective was MMC alone. It is proposed that the effectiveness of MMC is owed to its direct effect on CCM, a vital region of tumor metabolism.",

To illustrate these processes, this review summarizes recent findings from trials investigating the use of two hormokines, procalcitonin (PCT) or proadrenomedullin (ProADM), in personalized treatment and management decisions in CAP patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Many biomarkers from distinct pathophysiological pathways have been evaluated in observational studies. However, only few analytes have been tested for efficacy and safety in numerous, large observational studies or in prospective, randomized, interventional trials. Among the latter, PCT has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and highly effective for monitoring and de-escalating antibiotic therapy. ProADM has shown higher accuracy for short-term and long-term adverse outcome prediction and improves prognostic accuracy when combined with current clinical risk scores, that is, Pneumonia Severity Index, the CURB65 (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age at least 65 years) score, and Risk of Early Admission to ICU, compared to applying the respective score alone. ProADM use has - in a pilot interventional study - improved site-of-care decisions and tended to shorten length hospitalization. SUMMARY: Inclusion of biomarker data in clinical algorithms improves individual decision-making in CAP patients. Interventional trials should be conducted to determine these markers' ultimate utility in patient management.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with an active HGF/c-Met signaling pathway have a significantly worse prognosis. Although targeting the HGF/c-Met pathway has been proposed for the treatment of multiple cancers, the effect of c-Met inhibition in HCC remains unclear. The human HCC cell lines Huh7, Hep3B, MHCC97-L, and MHCC97-H were used in this study to investigate the effect of c-Met inhibition using the small molecule selective c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor PHA665752. MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H cells demonstrate a mesenchymal phenotype with decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of c-Met, fibronectin, and Zeb2 compared with Huh7 and Hep3B cells, which have an epithelial phenotype. PHA665752 treatment blocked phosphorylation of c-Met and downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk pathways, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in c-Met-positive MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H cells. In xenograft models, administration of PHA665752 significantly inhibited c-Met-positive MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H tumor growth, and PHA665752-treated tumors demonstrated marked reduction of both c-Met phosphorylation and cell proliferation. c-Met-negative Huh7 and Hep3B cells were not affected by c-Met inhibitor treatment in vitro or in vivo. In addition, c-Met-positive MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H cells demonstrated cancer stem cell-like characteristics, such as resistance to chemotherapy, tumor sphere formation, and increased expression of CD44 and ABCG2, and PHA665752 treatment suppressed tumor sphere formation and inhibited CD44 expression.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: c-Met represents a potential target of personalized treatment for HCC with an active HGF/c-Met pathway.",

Despite their improved rate of sustained virological response (SVR), DAAs pose increased risks of side effects and selection for antiviral resistance. Not all patients require DAA to achieve SVR, whereas others are unlikely to respond even to triple therapy. Therefore, a personalized approach to candidate selection is necessary.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this retrospective study, data from 640 Japanese patients who were treated for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1, 2, or 3 with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy was compiled to identify robust pretreatment predictive factors for SVR.\\n\\nRESULTS: A logistic regression model for personalized therapy was developed based on age, viral genotype, initial viral load, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, \u03b1-fetoprotein levels, and IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype.

New technologies, including next-generation sequencing, the 'omics' and powerful computers provide massive amounts of accurate data. However, attempts to understand complex disorders by applying these new technologies within the 20(th) century framework have failed to produce the expected medical advances. To help physicians embrace a paradigm shift, the limitations of the old framework and major advantages of the new framework must be demonstrated.

In the early 1990s, platinum-based regimens became the backbone of treatment for this disease. In 2002, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1594 clinical trial showed that there was no overall survival difference among four common chemotherapy regimens used in nonsmall-cell lung cancer. It was not until 2006 when the introduction of biologic agents into the field of lung cancer improved, for the first time ever, median overall survival beyond 1 year. To date, we recognize that there are differences between all histologic subtypes of nonsmall-cell lung cancer in terms of their response to specific agents. All these plus the introduction of molecular medicine have resulted in the identification of markers for prognosis and prediction in lung cancer. In this review, we describe the actual and ongoing clinical efforts to validate the prognostic and predictive value of these potential markers in lung cancer. We hope that the clinical use of biomarkers will help us to deliver personalized medicine to our lung cancer patients by improving their quality of response which may translate into further survival advantage. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of tolerance to self-nuclear antigens. The symptoms of SLE, progression of pathology and the array of autoantibodies present in the serum differ significantly from patient to patient, which calls for a personalized approach to treatment. SLE is polygenic and strongly influenced by gender, ethnicity, and environmental factors. Data from genome-wide association studies suggests that polymorphisms in as many as 100 genes contribute to SLE susceptibility. Recent research has focused on genes associated with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), type I interferons, immune regulation pathways, and immune-complex clearance. TLR7 and TLR9 have been extensively studied using lupus-prone mouse models. In multiple systems overexpression of TLR7 drives disease progression but interestingly, a loss of TLR9 results in an almost identical phenotype. While TLR7 overexpression has been linked to human SLE, the possible role of TLR9 in human disease remains elusive. In the present review, we focus on TLR polymorphisms and TLR expression in SLE patients and discuss their potential as biomarkers for individualized treatment.",

Patients with this autosomal dominant disorder have a shortened life expectancy due to complications from ruptured vessels or hollow organs. We tested the effectiveness of allele-specific RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the mutated phenotype in fibroblasts. Small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) discriminating between wild-type and mutant COL3A1 allele were identified by a luciferase reporter gene assay and in primary fibroblasts from a normal donor and a patient with vEDS. The best discriminative siRNA with the mutation at position 10 resulted in >90% silencing of the mutant allele without affecting the wild-type allele. Transmission and immunogold electron microscopy of extracted extracellular matrices from untreated fibroblasts of the patient with vEDS revealed structurally abnormal fibrils. After siRNA treatment, collagen fibrils became similar to fibrils from fibroblasts of normal and COL3A1 haploinsufficient donors. In addition, it was shown that expression of mutated COL3A1 activates the unfolded protein response and that reduction of the amount of mutated protein by siRNA reduces cellular stress. Taken together, the results provide evidence that allele-specific siRNAs are able to reduce negative effects of mutated COL3A1 proteins. Thus, the application of allele-specific RNAi may be a promising direction for future personalized therapies to reduce the severity of vEDS.",

However, practical limitations of existing approaches include both the low accuracy of the simplified analytical models and empirical expert-defined rules and the insufficient interpretability and stability of the pure data-driven models. Such challenges are typical for automated diagnostics from high-resolution image data and multi-channel temporal physiological information available in modern clinical settings. In addition, increasing number of portable and wearable systems for collection of physiological data outside medical facilities provide an opportunity for express and remote diagnostics as well as early detection of irregular and transient patterns caused by developing abnormalities or subtle initial effects of new treatments. However, quantitative modeling in such applications is even more challenging due to obvious limitations on the number of data channels, increased noise and non-stationary nature of considered tasks. Methods from nonlinear dynamics (NLD) are natural modeling tools for adaptive biological systems with multiple feedback loops and are capable of inferring essential dynamic properties from just one or a small number of data channels. However, most NLD indicators require long periods of data for stable calculation which significantly limits their practical value. Many of these challenges in biomedical modeling could be overcome by boosting and similar ensemble learning techniques that are capable of discovering robust multi-component meta-models from existing simplified models and other incomplete empirical knowledge. Here we describe an application of this approach to a practical system for express diagnostics and early detection of treatment responses from short beat-to-beat heart rate (RR) time series. The proposed system could play a key role in many applications relevant to e-healthcare, personalized medicine, express and remote web-enabled diagnostics, decision support systems, treatment optimization and others. \u00a9 2010 ACM.",

We studied paired (tumor and surrounding healthy) fresh frozen tissue from 86 CRC patients using Illumina's Infinium-based SNP array. This method allowed us to study CIN in CRC, with simultaneous analysis of copy number (CN) and B-allele frequency (BAF)--a representation of allelic composition. These data helped us to detect mono-allelic and bi-allelic amplifications/deletion, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and levels of mosaicism for mixed cell populations, some of which can not be assessed with other methods that do not measure BAF. We identified associations between CN abnormalities and different CRC phenotypes (histological diagnosis, location, tumor grade, stage, MSI and presence of lymph node metastasis). We showed commonalities between regions of CN change observed in CRC and the regions reported in previous studies of other solid cancers (e.g. amplifications of 20q, 13q, 8q, 5p and deletions of 18q, 17p and 8p). From Therapeutic Target Database, we identified relevant drugs, targeted to the genes located in these regions with CN changes, approved or in trials for other cancers and common diseases. These drugs may be considered for future therapeutic trials in CRC, based on personalized cytogenetic diagnosis. We also found many regions, harboring genes, which are not currently targeted by any relevant drugs that may be considered for future drug discovery studies. Our study shows the application of high density SNP arrays for cytogenetic study in CRC and its potential utility for personalized treatment.",

METHODS: Sixty-nine Crohn's disease patients with IFX treatment failure were randomized to an intensified IFX regimen (n = 36) or personalized treatment defined by IFX and anti-IFX antibodies (n = 33). Health-related quality of life evaluated with the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and productivity evaluated with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI:CD) were assessed at treatment failure and after 4, 8, 12 and 20 weeks. RESULTS: Median IBDQ score at manifestation of IFX treatment failure was 40 and improved markedly in responders by 11 at weeks 4 and 8 (p < 0.001) and by 13 at weeks 12 and 20 (p < 0.001). Non-responders improved modestly at weeks 12 and 20 (increase of median 4, p < 0.05). Overall activity impairment was high at IFX failure (median 70%) and decreased substantially in responders (40-50%, p < 0.001) and to a lesser extent in non-responders (15-40%, p < 0.05). In employed patients (55%), absenteeism was negligible during the entire study period. However, median presenteeism was 40% at manifestation of IFX failure and decreased only among responders across time (decrease 10-30%, p < 0.05). Although anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy was discontinued in most patients handled by personalized treatment, IBDQ and WPAI:CD scores were similar in these patients compared with patients routinely dose-intensified on IFX. CONCLUSION: Regaining low disease activity after IFX failure is necessary for minimizing patient impairment and indirect disease-related costs. A personalized treatment strategy does not have a negative influence on patient-reported outcomes.",

To construct this procedure, we first utilize a parametric or semiparametric method to estimate individual-level treatment differences, and use these estimates to create an index scoring system for grouping patients. We then consistently estimate the average treatment difference for each subgroup of subjects via a nonparametric function estimation method. Furthermore, pointwise and simultaneous interval estimates are constructed to make inferences about such subgroup-specific treatment differences.

Objectives: To compare active interventions and usual care for glucose control in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) among persons with diabetes cared for by primary care physicians (PCPs) over the course of 1??year. Methods: Physician practices (n = 36) in 4 geographic areas are randomly assigned to 1 of 4 study groups. The intervention is a diabetes communication system, using mobile phones and patient/physician portals to allow patient-specific treatment and communication. All physicians receive American Diabetes Association (ADA) Guidelines for diabetes care. Patients with poor diabetes control (A1c ??? 7.5%) at baseline (n = 260) are enrolled in study groups based on PCP randomization. All study patients receive blood glucose (BG) meters and a year's supply of testing materials. Patients in three treatment groups select one of two mobile phone models, receive one-year unlimited mobile phone data and service plan, register on the web-based individual patient portal and receive study treatment phone software based on study assignment. Control group patients receive usual care from their PCP. The primary outcome is mean change in A1c over a 12-month intervention period. Conclusion: Traditional methods of disease management have not achieved adequate control for BG and other conditions important to persons with diabetes. Tools to improve communication between patients and PCPs may improve patient outcomes and be satisfactory to patients and physicians. This RCT is ongoing. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In addition to uncontrolled proliferation and genetic instability, GBM is characterized by a diffuse infiltration, developing long protrusions that penetrate deeply along the fibers of the white matter. These features, combined with the underestimation of the invading GBM area by available imaging techniques, make a definitive treatment of GBM particularly difficult. A multidisciplinary approach combining mathematical, clinical and radiological data has the potential to foster our understanding of GBM evolution in every single patient throughout his/her oncological history, in order to target therapeutic weapons in a patient-specific manner. In this work, we propose a continuous mechanical model and we perform numerical simulations of GBM invasion combining the main mechano-biological characteristics of GBM with the micro-structural information extracted from radiological images, i.e. by elaborating patient-specific Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data. The numerical simulations highlight the influence of the different biological parameters on tumor progression and they demonstrate the fundamental importance of including anisotropic and heterogeneous patient-specific DTI data in order to obtain a more accurate prediction of GBM evolution. The results of the proposed mathematical model have the potential to provide a relevant benefit for clinicians involved in the treatment of this particularly aggressive disease and, more importantly, they might drive progress towards improving tumor control and patient's prognosis.",

Targeted therapy for signaling pathways in cancer has met limited success in part due to the exceedingly interwoven nature of the pathways. In particular, the highly complex RAS network has been challenging to target. Effectively targeting the pathway requires development of techniques that measure global network activity to account for pathway complexity. For this purpose, we used a gene-expression-based biomarker for RAS network activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and screened for drugs whose efficacy was significantly highly correlated to RAS network activity. Results identified EGFR and MEK co-inhibition as the most effective treatment for RAS-active NSCLC amongst a panel of over 360 compounds and fractions. RAS activity was identified in both RAS-mutant and wild-type lines, indicating broad characterization of RAS signaling inclusive of multiple mechanisms of RAS activity, and not solely based on mutation status. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that co-inhibition of EGFR and MEK induced apoptosis and blocked both EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and EGFR-PI3K-AKT-RPS6 nodes simultaneously in RAS-active, but not RAS-inactive NSCLC.

        "abstract": "VEGFR and HER2 are both important transmembrane proteins associated with several types of cancer. Overexpression of these 2 proteins had long been thought to contribute to cancer progression and poor outcomes, thus, therapies targeting HER-2 and VEGFA signaling pathways have been applied in recent years.Herceptin is a HER-2 targeted antibody that being widely used for the management of HER-2 positive breast cancer, which demonstrate significant benefits in both the metastatic and adjuvant settings. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients despite treatment in as early as 10. months. Identification of subpopulations best suited for and most likely to respond to Herceptin is of utmost importance. We analyzed the signaling pathways of HER-2 and found that HER-2 shares a very similar downstream network with VEGFA, while LGR5 lies in the upstream of VEGFA and could promotes its expression through CTNNB1. This discovery suggests that the LGR5 directed VEGFA overexpression may activate downstream signals of HER-2 despite Herceptin treatment.Here, we hypothesized that in LGR5 overexpressing breast cancer cases, activation of VEGFA-VRGFR bypass may account for the resistance to HER-2 directed therapies. Concurrent inhibition of VEGFR might enhance Herceptin sensitivity and moreover reverse the resistant phenotype in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Thus, we proposed alternate regimens to increase the efficacy of Herceptin-based therapy. Nevertheless, wet lab experiments and clinical trials are still required. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

New recurrent alterations have been identified in PCa (e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG translocation, SPOP and CHD1 mutations, and chromoplexy), and many previous ones in well-established pathways have been validated (e.g., androgen receptor overexpression and mutations; PTEN, RB1, and TP53 loss/mutations). With its highly heterogeneous nature, PCa continues to pose a tremendous challenge in terms of diagnosis and prognosis. Combining the information gained through NGS studies with clinicopathological and radiological data will help diagnose the aggressiveness of the cancer with greater accuracy. Furthermore, understanding the heterogeneity of tumor through single-cell or single-molecule sequencing technology will also strengthen the prognosis and provide better, patient-specific drug identification. As this research becomes more prominent, it is important that urologic oncologists become familiar with the various NGS technologies and the results generated using them.

Although most patients initially respond to targeted therapy, acquired resistance can still develop eventually. Most of the patients suffer from intrinsic (genetic) resistance as well, suggesting that there is substantial need to broaden our knowledge in the field of RCC genetics. As molecular abnormalities occur for various reasons, ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms to large chromosomal defects, conducting whole-genome association studies using high-throughput techniques seems inevitable. In principle, data obtained via genome-wide research should be continued and performed on a large scale for the purposes of drug development and identification of biological pathways underlying cancerogenesis. Genetic alterations are mostly unique for each histological RCC subtype. According to recently published data, RCC is a highly heterogeneous tumor. In this paper, the authors discuss the following: (1) current state-of-the-art knowledge on the potential biomarkers of RCC subtypes; (2) significant obstacles encountered in the translational research on RCC; and (3) recent molecular findings that may have a crucial impact on future therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "While for other complex disorders like cancer a limited number of markers are at hand, there are currently no biomarkers available for major depression. A major goal is therefore the identification of biomarkers that can categorize subsets of patients in a consistent manner. Biomarkers for mood disorders provides discovery strategies from scientists in academia and pharma and biotech industries. This will allow a more precise definition of psychiatric disorders and in turn facilitate investigations of the pathophysiology and enhance the ability for patient treatment. Moreover, pharmacogenomics is a new area of medicine that uses the data emerging from the sequencing of the human genome to predict drug responses and to identify new targets for treatment. Pharmacogenomics is of particular relevance to depression, which is a common and complex disorder of unknown cause for which prediction of treatment response and identification of new targets for therapeutics is of crucial importance. Depression represents major health problems in the 21 st century, and is major causes of disability. The fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the effects of psychopharmacological treatments are unknown. Pharmacogenomic approaches to psychiatric disorders offer the possibility to identify a network of genes that may underlie the mechanisms of psychotropic drugs, and the possibility of identifying groups of individuals who are more likely to respond to specific drugs or to suffer from side effects. Such efforts will lead to novel therapeutic targets for drug development and to the individualization of treatment, maximizing the likelihood of positive therapeutic outcomes. In this paper we review studies that has been focused on the prediction of antidepressants response based on genotype. We will also address the methodological issues that are emerging in the context of clinical pharmacogenomic and biomarker's investigation.",

As a preliminary step, we conducted a proof-of-concept study to test whether particular emotion regulatory neural circuitry can be differentially targeted by specific neurocognitive tasks, and whether these tasks effectively inhibit amygdala activity. Eleven healthy individuals underwent an idiographic sadness and guilt induction. Brain response was measured via fMRI during 4 subsequent emotion regulation conditions: fixation, cognitive reappraisal (selected to target the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), working memory practice (selected to target the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and visual distraction (Tetris; selected to target occipital cortex). In whole-brain comparisons to fixation, hypotheses were upheld. Reappraisal uniquely activated left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, working memory practice uniquely activated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and Tetris uniquely activated bilateral occipitoparietal cortex, activations that were largely robust at the single-subject level. All tasks inhibited amygdala activity relative to fixation. Data support examining whether repeated exposure to these tasks in psychiatric patients affects neural abnormalities implicated in emotional disorders. Ideally, psychiatric treatment will be accelerated by matching specific treatments to patients with specific neural profiles.",

Unfortunately, resistance to TKIs invariably develops. Many promising new therapies are under investigation to overcome the resistance. Areas covered: We analyzed the current primary literature and recent national meetings to evaluate the clinical characteristics and therapeutic implications of relevant treatments for EGFR mutant and ALK-positive NSCLC in the first-line, acquired resistance, and adjuvant settings. Expert opinion: Treatment with EGFR TKIs in the first-line setting of EGFR mutant NSCLC results in a significant clinical benefit. Several promising third generation EGFR TKIs are being evaluated in Phase II and III trials in the acquired resistance setting. Crizotinib is superior to chemotherapy in the first-line setting for ALK-positive NSCLC. Ceritinib is effective and approved for ALK-positive NSCLC in the acquired resistance setting.

Current therapies are associated with severe side effects making it problematic for many multi-morbid patients to receive treatment. Prostate specific antigen, serum response factor (SRF), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), HIF-2alpha, E2F1 and Survivin are well known proteins being overexpressed in cancer cells, expediting cell growth and also demonstrated in prostate cancer cells. Targeting these genes using the RNA-Interference pathway could be a new approach for prostate cancer therapy with fewer side effects. Methods: Three prostate cancer cell lines were cultured under standard conditions and transfected with three different concentrations (25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM) of specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SRF, STAT3, HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha, E2F1 and Survivin in a non-viral manner. Cells treated with non-specific siRNA (SCR-siRNA) served as control. Changes of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The analysis of the effect of siRNA on the number of cells was detected using CASY cell counter system. Results: Transfections of the PC-3 cell line with specific siRNA especially against Survivin, E2F1, HIF1alpha- and HIF2alpha-siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of intracellular mRNA concentration together with a significant decreased number of cells. In the LnCAP and DU-145 cell lines Survivin and E2F1 showed similar effects. The impact of silencing STAT3 or SRF showed little influence on the amount of cells in all three cell lines. Conclusions: This study shows that RNAi succeeds in silencing gene expression and reducing the number of cells in differing dimensions depending on the transfected cell line and used siRNA.",

However, this substance has a very poor biodistribution and absorption in animal tissues. This preclinical trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of various DIM formulations in animal model.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacokinetic parameters of one crystalline DIM formulation and one liquid DIM formulation (oil solution) compared to non-formulated crystalline DIM (control) were tested in 200 rats. The formulations were orally administered to animals by gavage at doses of 200\u00a0mg/kg per DIM (crystalline DIM formulation and non-formulated crystalline DIM) and 0.1\u00a0mg/kg per DIM (DIM in oil solution). DIM plasma elimination was measured using HPLC method; after that, the area under the curve (AUC), relative bioavailability, and absolute bioavailability were estimated for two formulations in relation to non-formulated crystalline DIM.\\n\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The highest bioavailability was achieved by administering liquid DIM (oil solution), containing cod liver oil and polysorbate. The level of DIM in rat blood plasma was about fivefold higher, though the 2,000-fold lower dose was administered compared to crystalline DIM forms. The novel pharmacological DIM substance with high bioavailability may be considered as a promising targeted antitumor chemopreventive agent. It could be used to prevent breast and ovarian cancer development in patients with heterozygous inherited and sporadic BRCA1 gene mutations. Further preclinical and clinical trials are needed to prove this concept.",

The importance of personalized treatment of COPD is increasingly recognized. The new GOLD guidelines have moved the principles of treatment of stable COPD forward by including concepts of symptoms and risks into the decision for therapy. COPD phenotypes are the basis of personalized treatment in clinical practice. Consensus has been reached concerning several phenotypes: phenotypes according to the evaluation of image; the frequent exacerbator and infrequent exacerbator; asthma and COPD overlap syndrome; and the persistent systemic inflammation phenotype. These phenotypes can help clinicians identify patients that respond to specific pharmacological interventions. Comorbidities and other factors, such as social and economic status, must also be considered. Future research needs to validate potential phenotypes in longitudinal studies, and examine the responses of different phenotypes to existing and future therapies.

However, the reported chemotherapy induced switching off of CD30 noted on immunohistochemistry may affect its therapeutic potential for disease relapse. We evaluated persistent CD30 expression and its prognostic meaning in cases of post-chemotherapy residual disease. Materials and Methods: Paraffin blocks of surgical samples that yielded nonteratomatous viable cells after 1 or more cisplatin based chemotherapy treatments were retrieved and reassessed by 2 pathologists blinded to the study purpose. Multivariable analysis was done for prespecified factors. Results: A total of 49 cases of pure embryonal carcinoma or mixed germ cell tumor from August 1991 to August 2012 had full clinical data and suitable tissue available for analysis. Of the 35 cases (71.4%, 95% CI 56.7-83.4) with preserved CD30 positivity 14 (40.0%) showed residual disease after a median of 1 regimen (IQR 1-2). Five-year overall survival in CD30 positive and negative cases was 37.0% (95% CI 22.1-61.8) and 50.1% (95% CI 27.9-90.0, p = 0.078), while after first line treatment it was 23.2% (95% CI 8.6-62.5) and 47.6% (95% CI 18.8-100, p = 0.025), respectively. On multivariable analysis CD30 positivity was a significant prognostic factor for progression-free survival (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.04-5.19) and overall survival (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.05-7.29). Conclusions: CD30 was retained even after an intensive pretreatment load, confirming that it is a reliable treatment target. Its expression was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis in multiple relapse/chemoresistant cases and it was an independent prognostic factor for survival. \u00a9 2013 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.",

        "abstract": "Objective Lithium salts, once the mainstay of therapy for bipolar disorder, have tolerability issues at a higher dosage that often limit adherence. The authors investigated the comparative effectiveness of more tolerable dosages of lithium as part of optimized personalized treatment (OPT). Method The authors randomly assigned 283 bipolar disorder outpatients to 6 months of open, flexible, moderate dosages of lithium plus OPT or to 6 months of OPT alone. The primary outcome measures were the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar Disorder\u2013Severity (CGI-BP-S) and \u201cnecessary clinical adjustments\u201d (medication adjustments per month). Secondary outcome measures included mood symptoms and functioning. The authors also assessed sustained remission (defined as a CGI-BP-S score \u22642 for 2 months) and treatment with second-generation antipsychotics. The authors hypothesized that lithium plus OPT would result in greater clinical improvement and fewer necessary clinical adjustments. Results The authors observed no statistically significant advantage of lithium plus OPT on CGI-BP-S scores, necessary clinical adjustments, or proportion with sustained remission. Both groups had similar outcomes across secondary clinical and functional measures. Fewer patients in the lithium-plus-OPT group received second-generation antipsychotics compared with the OPT-only group (48.3% and 62.5%, respectively). Conclusions In this pragmatic comparative effectiveness study, a moderate but tolerated dosage of lithium plus OPT conferred no symptomatic advantage when compared with OPT alone, but the lithium-plus-OPT group had less exposure to second-generation antipsychotics. Only about one-quarter of patients in both groups achieved sustained remission of symptoms. These findings highlight the persistent and chronic nature of bipolar disorder as well as the magnitude of unmet needs in its treatment.",

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common pathological type of lung cancer, divided into squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Despite better techniques of surgery and improvement in adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy, the median survival of advanced NSCLC is only 8-10 months. With increased understanding of molecular alternations in NSCLC, considerable efforts have focused on the development of personalized molecular-targeted therapies. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates tumor development, growth, and proliferation of NSCLC. Various novel inhibitors targeting this pathway have been identified in preclinical studies or clinical trials. Some genetic alternations may be considered sensitive or resistant biomarkers to these inhibitors. Sometimes, upregulation of RTK and the downstream PI3K pathway or upregulation of the ERK pathway by compensatory feedback reactivation in response to these inhibitors also lead to drug resistance. Therefore, combination therapy of these inhibitors and other targeted inhibitors such as EGFR-TKI or MEK inhibitors according to genetic status and categories of inhibitors is required to enhance the efficacy of these inhibitors. Here, we reviewed the genetic status of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in NSCLC and the novel inhibitors targeting this pathway in preclinical or clinical studies, exploring the possible genetic alternations related to different inhibitors and the means to enhance the antitumor effect in NSCLC.",

This intervention has wide-ranging clinical benefits and is gaining empirical support as an adjunct therapy for biobehavioral disorders, including asthma and depression. Yet, little is known about the system-level cardiovascular changes that occur during resonance breathing or the extent to which individuals differ in cardiovascular benefit. This study used a computational physiology approach to dynamically model the human cardiovascular system at rest and during resonance breathing. Noninvasive measurements of heart period, beat-to-beat systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and respiration period were obtained from 24 healthy young men and women. A model with respiration as input was parameterized to better understand how the cardiovascular processes that control variability in heart period and blood pressure change from rest to resonance breathing. The cost function used in model calibration corresponded to the difference between the experimental data and model outputs. A good match was observed between the data and model outputs (heart period, blood pressure, and corresponding power spectral densities). Significant improvements in several modeled cardiovascular functions (e.g., blood flow to internal organs, sensitivity of the sympathetic component of the baroreflex, ventricular elastance) were observed during resonance breathing. Individual differences in the magnitude and nature of these dynamic responses suggest that computational physiology may be clinically useful for tailoring heart rate variability biofeedback interventions for the needs of individual patients.",

However, the emphasis has been on simulating average or exemplar cases. This report describes two classes of cardiac modeling efforts. First, electrophysiological models of channelopathies simulate the altered electrical activity that is thought to promote arrhythmias. Second, electromechanical models attempt to capture both the electrophysiological and mechanical aspects of heart function. One goal of the community is to develop models with sufficient patient customization to assist in personalized treatment planning. Some model aspects can be customized with existing data collection techniques to more closely represent individual patients while other model aspects will likely remain based on generic data.

The goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new 21-gene assay (ODX) when used in conjunction with the Adjuvant! Online (AO) decision aid to support personalized decisions about use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer patients in Austria. We applied a validated discrete-event-simulation model to a hypothetical cohort of 50\u00a0years old women over a lifetime horizon. The test-treatment strategies of interest were defined using three-letter acronyms. The first (second, third) letter indicates whether patients with a low (intermediate, high) risk according to AO were tested using ODX (Y yes, N no). The main outcomes were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and cost effectiveness. Robustness of the results was tested in sensitivity analyses. Results were compared to a Canadian analysis conducted by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA). Five of eight strategies were dominated (i.e., more costly and less effective: NNY, NYN, YNN, YNY, YYN). The base-case analysis shows that YYY (ODX provided to all patients) is the most effective strategy and is cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 15,700 EUR per QALY gained. These results are sensitive to changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence, age and costs of chemotherapy. The results of the base-case analysis were comparable to the THETA results. Based on our analyses, using ODX in addition to AO is effective and cost effective in all women in Austria. The development of future genetic tests may require alternative or additional test-treatment strategies to be evaluated.",

We aimed to make a parallel between the sensitivity to targeted therapies on living patients and on cells derived from the initial tumor. Three patients diagnosed with a metastatic RCC (one clear cell RCC [ccRCC], two TFE3 RCC) were treated with anti-angiogenesis drugs. The concentrations of the different drugs giving 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50) were determined with the Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay on cells from the primary tumors and a reference sensitive RCC cell line (786-O).

In vitro experiments may represent a method for evaluating the best first-line treatment for personalized management of ccRCC during the period following surgery.",

But the time and resources needed to deliver such advances may be significantly greater than optimists expect. Given current methodologies, drugs for limited numbers of older patients are also much less likely to be judged cost effective than treatments for more common conditions in younger populations. There is a consequent danger that private and public funding for personalized medicine development will in the future fall to a level that is significantly below the global publics best interests. Policy-makers should be aware of this risk, and take actions to mitigate it. These include minimizing the costs and complexities associated with marketing personalized medicines and linked diagnostic tests, as well as strengthening intellectual property protection in ways that will allow 'rich world pharmaceutical price moderation, increased innovator security and enhanced treatment access for poorer populations. \u00a9 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.",

We illustrate the issues involved by describing a pregnancy management case in which a treatment plan was modified based on a DTC result. A woman whose personal and family history were otherwise unremarkable for thromboembolism learned through DTC testing about the presence of a prothrombin (factor 2) gene mutation (rs1799963). Twice daily injections of enoxaparin were recommended throughout pregnancy for this patient who, without prior knowledge of this mutation, would not have been offered such therapy. Moreover, genetically based medical guidelines are a moving target, and treatment of thrombophilic conditions in asymptomatic patients is controversial. We address the state of the art in actionable personalized medicine with respect to clotting disorders in pregnancy, as well as other factors at play- economics, patient preference, and clinical decision support. We also discuss what steps are needed to increase the utility of genomic data in personalized medicine by collecting information and converting it into actionable knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Background: After initial treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients are followed with thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements to detect recurrences. In case of elevated levels of Tg and negative neck ultrasonography, patients are treated 'blindly' with Iodine-131 (131I). However, in up to 50% of patients, the post-therapy scan reveals no 131I-targeting of tumor lesions. Such patients derive no benefit from the blind therapy but are exposed to its toxicity. Alternatively, iodine-124 (124I) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) has become available to visualize DTC lesions and without toxicity. In addition to this, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT detects the recurrent DTC phenotype, which lost the capacity to accumulate iodine. Taken together, the combination of 124I and 18F-FDG PET/CT has potential to stratify patients for treatment with 131I.Methods/Design: In a multicenter prospective observational cohort study the hypothesis that the combination of 124I and 18F-FDG PET/CT can avoid futile 131I treatments in patients planned for 'blind' therapy with 131I, is tested.One hundred patients planned for 131I undergo both 124I and 18F-FDG PET/CT after rhTSH stimulation. Independent of the outcome of the scans, all patients will subsequently receive, after thyroid hormone withdrawal, the 131I therapy. The post 131I therapeutic scintigraphy is compared with the outcome of the 124I and 18F-FDG PET/CT in order to evaluate the diagnostic value of the combined PET modalities.This study primary aims to reduce the number of futile 131I therapies. Secondary aims are the nationwide introduction of 124I PET/CT by a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program, to correlate imaging outcome with histopathological features, to compare 124I PET/CT after rhTSH and after withdrawal of thyroid hormone, and to compare 124I and 131I dosimetry.Discussion: This study aims to evaluate the potential value of the combination of 124I and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the prevention of futile 131I therapies in patients with biochemically suspected recurrence of DTC. To our best knowledge no studies addressed this in a prospective cohort of patients. This is of great clinical importance as a futile 131I is a costly treatment associated with morbidity and therefore should be restricted to those likely to benefit from this treatment.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01641679.

The genomic revolution is rapidly identifying the genetic contribution to the diseased state as well as its contribution to drug efficacy and toxicity. The ability to perform genome-wide studies has led to an overwhelming number of candidate genes and/or their associated variants; however, understanding which are of therapeutic importance is becoming the greatest unmet need in the personalized medicine field. A related issue is the need to improve our methods of identifying and characterizing therapeutic drugs in the context of the complex genomic landscape of the intact body. Drosophila have proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the basic biological mechanisms of human development. This article will review Drosophila as a whole animal tool for gene and drug discovery. We will examine how Drosophila can be used to both sort through the myriad of hits coming from human genome-wide scans and to dramatically improve the early steps in pharmaceutical drug development.

Noninvasive detection of ailments and monitoring therapy by human breath analysis is an emerging field of medical diagnostics representing a rapid, economic and simple alternative to standard invasive blood analysis, endoscopy or harmful imaging techniques such as x-ray and CT scans",

In this article, based on a literature review, we examine how the terms have arisen and their various meanings and definitions. We discuss the impact of the new technologies on disease classification, prevention and management. We suggest that although genomics and molecular biosciences will undoubtedly greatly enhance the power of medicine, they will not lead to a conceptually new paradigm of medical care. What is new is the portfolio of modern tools that medicine and healthcare can use for better targeted approaches to health and disease management, and the sociopolitical contexts within which these tools are applied.",

Despite some advances, adoption has been sporadic and there remains a lack of consensus about what personalized healthcare actually means. This confusion has often resulted from the mistake of equating personalized medicine with genomic medicine, and thereby, attributing it as yet unfulfilled expectations of genomic medicine to the broader application of personalized medicine. The lack of a clear understanding of personalized medicine has limited its adoption within clinical delivery models. It is thus essential to reach a consensus regarding what personalized healthcare and its components mean.

However, while the clinical translation of drug metabolism and cancer-related genomics data has resulted in accepted individualized treatment paradigms, this has not occurred as frequently or efficiently for patients with common chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This gap between the rapidly increasing amount of disease-related genomic information and its clinical translation can be addressed through the creation and testing of personalized medicine treatment hypotheses using the same strategies that translational medicine scientists utilize to achieve proof-of-concept for drugs with novel targets. This is illustrated with three testable personalized medicine hypotheses for rheumatoid arthritis where known genetic markers in patients can potentially be used to select the most appropriate treatments and dose. Incentives resulting from changes in government and regulatory agency policies, investments in sample and data repositories, acceptance of new economic models by pharmaceutical companies and third party payers as well as more training, research support and academic opportunities for translational medicine scientists are all needed to speed up the implementation of personalized medicine for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other common chronic diseases. \u00a9 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\u03b1-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD \u2264 2.0 \u00c5 for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",

For healthcare providers and their patients, advances in genomics and other related fields must be captured by sophisticated decision support systems that integrate information from multiple sources of data and facilitate their use in the clinic. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, regulators will also need to work toward establishing evidentiary standards for the use of data from electronic clinical sources in areas such as comparative effectiveness and safety, while addressing the complexity behind the genetic basis of the exceptions to their general findings. Overall, the increased use of HIT will allow for a more integrated, efficient system for collecting and analyzing clinical data, providing a fruitful environment for hypothesis testing and generation, as well as leading to more personalized and effecti...",

Recent genetic research explains the variations and similarities between humans, their diseases, and their responses to various treatments. Because governments and universities have not set strict standards, there are numerous tests and kits available to detect genetic problems. But are these kits accurate? The validity of some biomarkers is suspect. The ethics of personalized medicine became an issue when some laboratory tests resulted in women incorrectly having been told that they have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer when they did not. Ethical issues are not confined to the utilization of genetic information, but can be raised with the acquisition of human material for the advancement of knowledge. Whose genes are these? Who owns your DNA? In the US, patients are given prenatal genetic advice upon which they can decide for themselves how to proceed. But in Russia, patients have no choice. The state makes most decisions. Selective breeding would be unacceptable in western countries.",

At least 15 genes (e.g., ESR1, LRP5, SOST, OPG, RANK and RANKL) have been confirmed as osteoporosis susceptibility genes, and another 30 have been highlighted as promising susceptibility genes. Notably, these genes are clustered in three biological pathways: the estrogen endocrine pathway, the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and the RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathway. In this article, using data pertaining to these three biological pathways as examples, we illustrate possible principles of personalized therapy for osteoporosis. In particular, we propose to use inhibitors (e.g., denosumab) of the RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway to circumvent resistance to estrogen-replacement therapy: a novel idea resulting from the consideration of a mechanistic link between the estrogen endocrine pathway and the RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway. In addition, we call for more attention to be focused on rare variants of major effects in future studies.",

Recognizing that scientific knowledge is a product of both technology and social systems that often remain unaccounted for (e.g., human values, distribution of power and human agency, immigration, racial disparities, socioeconomic class and equity, among other factors), \u00d6zdemir discovered the literature in the field of science and technology studies, a rich scholarly enquiry that asks fundamental questions and challenges assumptions regarding the backstage of technoscience, situates technology within its political context and makes hitherto unseen connections that frame science in ways that enable robust, responsible and sustainable innovation. From 2008 to 2012, \u00d6zdemir was awarded a mid-career 'science and society' fellowship in order to retool as an independent faculty and senior scientist in science and technology studies, conducting research on research and examining his own trade-pharmacogenetics science-as an insider on the outside.

A new paradigm of personalized medicine is emerging, which proactively tailors treatment to each individual's biological and psychological profile. The first proof-of-concept phase of personalized medicine has now been achieved. However, it has thus far focused on the use of genomic markers and on disorders of the body. The complexity of the brain is likely to require a shift from a single genetic marker focus to a more integrated approach in which additional brain-related information (neuromarkers) is taken into account. Codevelopment of genomic neuromarkers with new compounds in a personalized medicine approach will lead to increased drug R&D and treatment benefits. The emerging genomic neuromarker potential has begun to be incorporated into the template for the next version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V). The statistical power of large subject numbers in databases in general (and standardized databases in particular) provides an ideal source for elucidating the best genomic-neuromarker profiles (explaining most of the main-effects variance), which will empower a brain-related personalized medicine into mainstream clinical practice.",

Due to the growing complexity of society, it has become impossible to govern society from a single center or by means of a single privileged governance mechanism. Governing increasingly includes the active participation of nongovernmental and individual actors by means of creating informal norms of conduct.

Preliminary results suggest excellent local control rates of intrahepatic malignancies treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), but some patients have experienced life-threatening toxicity because the current approaches cannot accurately estimate residual liver function after treatment. An early-phase trial of SBRT in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, including those with compromised liver function, is described. Patients are treated with three fractions of SBRT, then treatment is paused for 4 weeks and liver function is evaluated by means of an indocyanine green assay. The size of the final two fractions of SBRT is determined based on the patient's indocyanine green assay after the first three fractions, so that the therapy is personalized to each patient's sensitivity to radiation. The sensitivity to the liver of the final two fractions of SBRT, compared with the first three fractions, is re-estimated using a Bayesian model throughout the trial, so this is an adaptive trial. The operating characteristics of the trial are described by Monte Carlo simulations.",

Conceptualizations such as the hallmarks of cancer are providing an organizing principle with which to distill and rationalize the abject complexities of cancer phenotypes and genotypes across the spectrum of the human disease. A countervailing reality, however, involves the variable and often transitory responses to most mechanism-based targeted therapies, returning full circle to the complexity, arguing that the unique biology and genetics of a patient's tumor will in the future necessarily need to be incorporated into the decisions about optimal treatment strategies, the frontier of personalized cancer medicine. This perspective highlights considerations, metrics, and methods that may prove instrumental in charting the landscape of evaluating individual tumors so to better inform diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Integral to the consideration is remarkable heterogeneity and variability, evidently embedded in cancer cells, but likely also in the cell types composing the supportive and interactive stroma of the tumor microenvironment (e.g., leukocytes and fibroblasts), whose diversity in form, regulation, function, and abundance may prove to rival that of the cancer cells themselves. By comprehensively interrogating both parenchyma and stroma of patients' cancers with a suite of parametric tools, the promise of mechanism-based therapy may truly be realized.",

Traditional biomedical ethics, led by the protection paradigm, was devised to serve a very different context. Today, compelling ethical questions arise from the tension between individual and collective interests in the context of population-based data collection and research. The collection of phenotype data, and the development of new sequencing technologies, raises burning questions that call for innovative tools and models in ethics.

However, there are multiple challenges to its adoption from many healthcare stakeholders.

From a commercial perspective, two different industries with distinct business models are involved: pharma and the diagnostics industry. In order for personalized medicine to have its desired impact, it is necessary that innovative business models from various sectors within healthcare are developed.

In modern medicine the most important sources of evidence are clinical trials using epidemiological methods, and molecular biological and genetic methods characterizing individual patients. Responses to a certain therapeutic intervention differ among patients for several reasons. Identifying benefits and harms of an intervention can be handled by two approaches. The first is a statistical approach using the rule of large numbers, resulting in statistically meaningful conclusions.

Fast-paced advances in genomic and proteomic laboratory technologies could enable the widespread use of molecular testing before therapy selection in any field of medicine. This article describes two potentially large obstructions to such innovation. First, laboratory tests have traditionally been commodities with low prices, prices that matched the resources required to operate the laboratory technology itself. Assuming that the marginal costs of molecular laboratory technology will fall, there will be a widening chasm between estimated test revenue and the costs of innovative and definitive clinical trials, and regulatory approval for new tests. Without corrective action, even cost-saving laboratory tests could be in shortfall, because they will not be created through upfront investment. Second, it is argued that while diagnostic tests, drugs and surgical procedures should meet a fundamental standard for payer coverage ('will health outcomes be improved?'), molecular diagnostics could require different analysis pathways than those that are used to evaluate interventions.",

Increased knowledge regarding genomics and the underlying biological mechanism of diseases should help us be able to stratify patients into groups of likely responders and nonresponders, and to identify those patients for whom a treatment might do more harm than good. This article sets out different policy perspectives for the healthcare systems, and draws in on 25 years of particular experience from the rare disease and orphan drug field, to illuminate the pathway forward in relation to key implementation aspects of personalized healthcare. In principle, we submit that targeting medicines to preidentified groups for whom we can predict a beneficial outcome is a good thing for everyone first of all for the patients, but also for all the other stakeholders, including payers, treating physicians and industry because it has the potential to create sustainable and functioning healthcare systems directed to better health and prevention of disease. Personalized healthcare over time could also lead to shorter drug-development times because of lower rates of failure in late-stage drug development. Using orphan medicines to treat well-diagnosed patients suffering from a life-threatening or seriously debilitating rare disease, is an attempt to work according to these principles. As there is much that needs to be done to turn the promise into reality, we need to identify the barriers and challenges to transform the potential opportunities into real-life benefits, and what needs to be done in order to overcome them. Learning from the field of rare diseases and orphan drugs may provide, perhaps unexpectedly, some of the answers to public policy questions related to future (personalized) healthcare, but of course not all aspects, are common between the two fields.",

However, as is often the case, a lack of understanding, tools and technologies are the root cause of such situations. Human individuality is an often-quoted term but, in the context of human biology, it is poorly understood. This is compounded when there is a need to consider the variability of human populations. In the case of the former, it is possible to quantify human complexity as determined by the 35,000 genes of the human genome, the 1-10 million proteins (including antibodies) and the 2000-3000 metabolites of the human metabolome. Human variability is much more difficult to assess, since many of the variables, such as the definition of race, are not even clearly agreed on. In order to accommodate human complexity, variability and its influence on health and disease, it is necessary to undertake a systematic approach. In the past decade, the emergence of analytical platforms and bioinformatics tools has led to the development of systems biology. Such an approach offers enormous potential in defining key pathways and networks involved in optimal human health, as well as disease onset, progression and treatment. The tools and technologies now available in systems biology analyses offer exciting opportunities to exploit the emerging areas of personalized medicine.

The differences between these two hazard rates can arise from frailty - differences among individuals that are not observed in a study. We posit that frailty modeling is a useful approach for risk analysis in personalized medicine because it provides a way to address the important and perplexing question of how to translate findings from population studies to the diagnosis and treatment of disease in specific individuals. Our suggestion is based on three unique advantages of frailty modeling: frailty modeling offers an effective approach to analyze the risks at both the individual and population levels and can be used to infer relationships between the two; frailty modeling can be used to analyze the dependence between survival events - one of the most difficult issues in any field that involves common risks; and frailty modeling can be used to describe unobserved or unobservable risks. Finally, we suggest that frailty modeling should be particularly useful in the study and treatment of diseases that are caused or influenced by the human microbiome. By doing so, truly 'personalized' medicine can advance based on a better understanding of the risks to both 'trees' (individuals) and 'forests' (populations).",

There are various reports on genetic associations between particular HLA allotypes and drug hypersensitivities and the strongest associations reported thus far, are with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor, abacavir and HLA-B*5701, the gout prophylactic allopurinol and HLA-B*5801 and the antiepileptic carbamazepine and B*1502, providing a defined disease trigger and suggesting a general mechanism for these associations. Recognizing the strong HLA association, the US FDA has recommended genetic testing before starting abacavir and carbamazepine therapies. To incorporate HLA testing for other drug hypersensitivities and life-threatening reactions it is essential first to establish clear HLA associations, and second, to understand the immune-mechanism by which these drugs induce HLA-linked hypersensitivity. The latter will provide insight into the pathologic mechanisms of drug allergy allowing rational immunotherapy for these life-threatening reactions and the development of alternative drug therapies for hypersensitive patients. 2010 Future Medicine Ltd",

However, these insights inform us that historical population sampling approaches for investigating rare and common genetic variations are not representative of the complex ancestral backgrounds of today's patients. In order for personalized medicine to be meaningful and applicable to the global populations, we will need to know how common and rare genetic variants found in different parts of the world influence health and drug response. This article demonstrates the importance of increasing ethnic and racial diversity among participants in genomic research, highlights areas of opportunity for improving our understanding of genomic diversity among populations, and provides examples of successful models that help to resolve these concerns.",

Results: Our findings indicate that approximately 60% of pharmacists consider their level of knowledge of personalized medicine to be very low, while over half of the pharmacists and physicians intimate that they would be unable to explain the results of pharmacogenomic tests to their customers or patients, respectively.

We focus on data from health payers who are key stakeholders in capacity building, as they need data to guide decisions and they develop data as part of operations. Broadly defined, health payers include insurance carriers, third party payers, health-plan sponsors and organized delivery systems. Data from health payers have not yet been widely used to assess personalized medicine. Now, with an increasing number of personalized technologies covered and reimbursed by health payers, and an increasing number of emerging technologies that will require policy decisions, there is a great opportunity to develop the evidence base using payer data and by engaging with these stakeholders. Here, we describe data that are available from, and are being developed by, health payers and assess how these data can be further developed to increase the capacity for future research, using three examples. The examples suggest that payer data can be used to examine clinical utility and approaches can be developed that simultaneously address the characteristics of personalized medicine, real world data and organizations.

Methods: A survey of US general (n = 1087) and physician (n = 100) populations using the willingness-to-pay method was carried out. Physicians responded from the perspective of a typical patient. x2 tests, t-tests and ordered logistic regression were used to examine factors associated with willingness to pay and intentions to be screened. Results: General population respondents' average willingness to pay for a genetic test for colorectal cancer risk was US$150. Higher willingness to pay was significantly associated with being male, having higher income and education, having private health insurance and reporting a greater likelihood of getting colorectal cancer screening when due. Physicians' beliefs about patients were different than general population responses: physicians believed patients would be willing to pay more (US$212; p < 0.001), fewer believed patients would not pay (1 vs 17%; p<0.001), and if a genetic test indicated higher than average risk, physicians believed patients would be more likely to get screened (65 vs 46%; p < 0.001) and would choose alternative screening tests (62 vs 22%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Respondents valued genetic tests to inform screening decisions and indicated that tests may influence screening choices. Additional studies are needed to examine the implications of physicians' beliefs about patients' choices for screening. \u00a9 2007 Future Medicine Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As today, there are hundreds of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer, many of which have companion biomarkers that are in use to inform treatment decisions. If we would consider this whole arsenal of targeted therapies as a treatment option for every patient, very soon we will reach a scenario where each patient is positive for several markers suggesting their treatment with several targeted therapies. Given the documented side effects of anticancer drugs, it is clear that such a strategy is unfeasible.\\n\\nRESULTS: Here, we propose a strategy that optimizes the design of combinatorial therapies to achieve the best response rates with the minimal toxicity. In this methodology markers are assigned to drugs such that we achieve a high overall response rate while using personalized combinations of minimal size. We tested this methodology in an in silico cancer patient cohort, constructed from in vitro data for 714 cell lines and 138 drugs reported by the Sanger Institute. Our analysis indicates that, even in the context of personalized medicine, combinations of three or more drugs are required to achieve high response rates. Furthermore, patient-to-patient variations in pharmacokinetics have a significant impact in the overall response rate. A 10 fold increase in the pharmacokinetics variations resulted in a significant drop the overall response rate.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The design of optimal combinatorial therapy for anticancer treatment requires a transition from the one-drug/one-biomarker approach to global strategies that simultaneously assign makers to a catalog of drugs. The methodology reported here provides a framework to achieve this transition.",

RESULTS: Most (73%) respondents have not heard of 'personalized medicine,' though after understanding the term most (95%) expect PM to have a positive beneft. Consumer's willingness to pay is associated with products' impact on survival, rather than predicting disease risk.

        "abstract": "Personalized medicine, with the aim of safely, effectively, and cost-effectively targeting treatment to a prespecified patient population, has always been a long-time goal within health care. It is often argued that personalizing treatment will inevitably improve clinical outcomes for patients and help achieve more effective use of health care resources. Demand is increasing for demonstrable evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness to support the use of personalized medicine in health care. This paper begins with an overview of the existing challenges in conducting economic evaluations of genetics- and genomics-targeted technologies, as an example of personalized medicine. Our paper illustrates the complexity of the challenges faced by these technologies by highlighting the variations in the issues faced by diagnostic tests for somatic variations, generally referring to genetic variation in a tumor, and germline variations, generally referring to inherited genetic variation in enzymes involved in drug metabolic pathways. These tests are typically aimed at stratifying patient populations into subgroups on the basis of clinical effectiveness (response) or safety (avoidance of adverse events). The paper summarizes the data requirements for economic evaluations of genetics and genomics-based technologies while outlining that the main challenges relating to data requirements revolve around the availability and quality of existing data. We conclude by discussing current developments aimed to address the challenges of assessing the cost-effectiveness of genetics and genomics-based technologies, which revolve around two central issues that are interlinked: the need to adapt available evaluation methods and identifying who is responsible for generating evidence for these technologies.",

What is clear is that alcohol dependence is a heterogeneous disorder with many contributing factors. These factors vary from person to person and are known to have a major impact on treatment outcome. This variability, in part, has contributed to the development of new treatments. More specifically, research gains in understanding the heterogeneity of addiction, coupled with the availability of a wide range of treatments, have opened the door to the possibility of personalized approaches to treatment.

But what impact could personalized medicine have on the drug development process, the pharmaceutical industry and international health, including that in developing countries? Can personalized medicines support innovation, sustainability and growth in the pharmaceutical industry and also respond to changing world realities, emerging public demands for safer and more efficacious medicines and equitable access to pharmaceuticals? The present paper examines these socio-ethical and science policy questions by first elucidating their intrinsic and often complex interactions with other economic and policy issues (and the often divergent interests of stakeholders). We then present some examples from other industries (e.g., the case of hybrid cars and attendant growth of consumer interest and confidence in high quality sustainable products), with a view to identifying the factors that might contribute to a successful integration of pharmacogenomics and related biomarker technologies in patient care, international health and public policy. In particular, we propose ways to integrate the concept of sustainability into corporate and investor models of pharmaceutical industry development. While the power of pharmacogenomics to serve as a driver for the pharmaceutical industry remains to be evaluated, we submit that biomedical innovation and economic prosperity can co-exist with ethical drug development and the sustainable commercialization of customized drug therapies. 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

Thus, understanding the molecular characteristics of both the tumour and the patient, and establishing their relation with drug outcomes will be critical for the identification of predictive biomarkers and to provide the basis for individualized treatments. This is a complex scenario where multiple genes as well as pathophysiological and environmental factors are important; in addition, tumours exhibit large inter- and intraindividual variability in space and time.

Recently it has been shown that therapeutic drug monitoring with additional CYP genotyping improved the treatment with antidepressants of patients in the general practice setting. Considerable effort has been put into developing a FDA approved DNA microarray, identifying multiple clinical relevant CYP polymorphisms at once. This could pave the way for a wide implementation of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical environment. Individual variability in drug response is not explained by variation of drug metabolism alone. Polymorphisms in neurotransmitter-receptor genes are gaining more interest since they are at the end of the line in determining psychotropic drug effects. Several studies have already shown that the response of antipsychotic drugs and antidepressants can be predicted by genotyping polymorphisms in serotonin receptors and transporter genes. The increased predictability of the different determinants in drug efficacy brings us a step closer to personalized medicine in psychiatry. 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "It is now almost twenty years since pharmacogenetics was heralded as the technology most likely to revolutionize medicine by providing personalized medicine to patients and health consumers. While much attention has been focused on the scientific limits and policy failures that have prevented the widespread uptake of personalized medicine to date, this feature article examines the socio-cultural and political aspects of pharmacogenomics and other related technologies such as online genetic testing that aim to deliver personalized medicine. I suggest that science and technology are \u2018 co-produced\u2019 with, and shaped by, culture, politics and economics in relation to one another. Drawing on the UK Nuffield Council of Bioethics' recently published report, Medical Profiling and Online Medicine: The Ethics of Personalized Healthcare in a Consumer Age, I explore the concept of the \u2018consumer\u2019 that has been built into these technologies and argue that despite the push from the commercial sector and the often uncritical acceptance of this by governments, the commercialization of personalized medicine will not succeed unless the benefits are considered as beneficial by those who use it. Such technologies do have the potential to improve healthcare but in order for this to be realized we need a more in-depth understanding of what patients and consumers actually want from such services and we must engage with them as well as doctors and other healthcare professionals. In particular more research is needed to document the experiences of patients and consumers who have utilized services to date, as well as how personalized medicine in its broadest sense is already being delivered by doctors and healthcare practitioners in the clinical context. Finally, a more robust \u2018 contextualized\u2019 development of personalized medicine will take considerable effort to achieve if we are to ensure that health inequalities are not further exasperated between the populations of more technologically and economically advanced countries and those living in poor less economically developed ones.",

The Japanese healthcare system and regulatory framework of genetic testing have been reviewed because they relate to the issue.

For example, we researched a predictive genetic testing program for diabetic complications and metabolic syndrome. Based on our interviews with physicians and experts, we identified the following factors that are critical to the effective use of genetic testing for primary prevention of lifestyle diseases: an institutional framework for evaluating the credibility of predictive genetic testing; psychological effects (both positive and negative) of predictive genetic testing; and education of physicians and other health professionals in lifestyle disease genetics and effective communication with patients. \u00a9 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Using different assumptions regarding the costs and effectiveness of genetic testing, we estimate that formally integrating genetic testing into routine warfarin therapy could allow American warfarin users to avoid 4500-22,000 serious bleeding events annually. Genetic-based therapy could also reduce the incidence of strokes among patients taking warfarin.

Coverage by insurers is a critical step in achieving widespread adoption of personalized medicine. Insurers consider a variety of factors when formulating medical coverage policies for personalized medicine, including the overall strength of evidence for a test, availability of clinical guidelines and health technology assessments by independent organizations. In this study, we reviewed coverage policies of the largest U.S. insurers for genomic (disease-related) and pharmacogenetic (PGx) tests to determine the extent that these tests were covered and the evidence basis for the coverage decisions. We identified 41 coverage policies for 49 unique testing: 22 tests for disease diagnosis, prognosis and risk and 27 PGx tests. Fifty percent (or less) of the tests reviewed were covered by insurers. Lack of evidence of clinical utility appears to be a major factor in decisions of non-coverage. The inclusion of PGx information in drug package inserts appears to be a common theme of PGx tests that are covered. This analysis highlights the variability of coverage determinations and factors considered, suggesting that the adoption of personal medicine will affected by numerous factors, but will continue to be slowed due to lack of demonstrated clinical benefit.",

Methods: Healthy People 2010 diagnoses were estimated for participants in the Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP), a large population-based biobank for residents aged 18 years and older living in central Wisconsin. By interrogating the electronic medical record, three parameters were calculated for each diagnosis: mean number of concomitant diagnoses, mean number of annual clinic visits before diagnosis and mean number of clinic visits after diagnosis. Results: A total of 18,239 adults enrolled in PMRP from September 2002 to May 2005 and were included in the study. They had a mean age of 49 years (standard deviation: 18.5), ranging from 18\u201398 years; 57% were female. At least one Healthy People 2010 disease was diagnosed in 86.4% of the participants; 13.6% had never been diagnosed with any of these conditions. The median number of diagnoses per subject was three (range: 1\u201315). The median number of annual visits after diagnosis was lowest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9.1) and highest for sleep apnea (17.9). Subjects with a diabetic retinopathy diagnosis had the highest number of concomitant diagnoses (mean: 6.8). Discussion: All of the diseases within the Healthy People 2010 list are purported to have at least some genetic component, with the exception of injuries. The PMRP cohort is large enough that diseases of public health importance can be studied in the context of a variety of clinical and environmental covariates. This database is being developed as a national resource and is particularly useful where the estimated disease prevalence is 5% or greater. For less common diseases, additional cases can be recruited from throughout the Marshfield Clinic system of care, with population-based controls selected from the main PMRP study cohort.",

However, such personalization of drug treatments requires the ability to predict how different individuals will respond to a particular drug/dose combination. After initial optimism, there is increasing recognition of the limitations of the pharmacogenomic approach, which does not take account of important environmental influences on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. For instance, a major factor underlying inter-individual variation in drug effects is variation in metabolic phenotype, which is influenced not only by genotype but also by environmental factors such as nutritional status, the gut microbiota, age, disease and the co- or pre-administration of other drugs. Thus, although genetic variation is clearly important, it seems unlikely that personalized drug therapy will be enabled for a wide range of major diseases using genomic knowledge alone. Here we describe an alternative and conceptually new 'pharmaco-metabonomic' approach to personalizing drug treatment, which uses a combination of pre-dose metabolite profiling and chemometrics to model and predict the responses of individual subjects. We provide proof-of-principle for this new approach, which is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences, with a study of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats. We show pre-dose prediction of an aspect of the urinary drug metabolite profile and an association between pre-dose urinary composition and the extent of liver damage sustained after paracetamol administration.",

As cancer is inherently a disease of the genome, it is not surprising to see NGS technology already being applied to cancer research with promises of greater understanding of carcinogenesis.

Methods: Healthy People 2010 diagnoses were estimated for participants in the Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP), a large population-based biobank for residents aged 18 years and older living in central Wisconsin. By interrogating the electronic medical record, three parameters were calculated for each diagnosis: mean number of concomitant diagnoses, mean number of annual clinic visits before diagnosis and mean number of clinic visits after diagnosis. Results: A total of 18,239 adults enrolled in PMRP from September 2002 to May 2005 and were included in the study. They had a mean age of 49 years (standard deviation: 18.5), ranging from 18-98 years; 57% were female. At least one Healthy People 2010 disease was diagnosed in 86.4% of the participants; 13.6% had never been diagnosed with any of these conditions. The median number of diagnoses per subject was three (range: 1-15). The median number of annual visits after diagnosis was lowest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9.1) and highest for sleep apnea (17.9). Subjects with a diabetic retinopathy diagnosis had the highest number of concomitant diagnoses (mean: 6.8). Discussion: All of the diseases within the Healthy People 2010 list are purported to have at least some genetic component, with the exception of injuries. The PMRP cohort is large enough that diseases of public health importance can be studied in the context of a variety of clinical and environmental covariates. This database is being developed as a national resource and is particularly useful where the estimated disease prevalence is 5% or greater. For less common diseases, additional cases can be recruited from throughout the Marshfield Clinic system of care, with population-based controls selected from the main PMRP study cohort. \u00a9 2007 Future Medicine Ltd.",

        "abstract": "While the full promise of genomic medicine may be many years in the future, personalized health care (PHC) can begin solving important health care needs now and provide a framework for the adoption of genomic technologies as they are validated. PHC is a strategic approach to medicine that is individualized, predictive, preventive, and involves intense patient engagement. There is great need for more effective models of care as nearly half of Medicare patients age 65 and older have three or more preventable chronic conditions and account for 89% of Medicare's growing expenditures. With its focus on reactive care, the current health care system is not designed to effectively prevent disease nor manage patients with multiple chronic conditions. PHC may be a solution for improving care for this population and therefore has been adopted as the delivery platform along with a new personalized health plan tool for 230 multi-morbid, homebound Medicare recipients in Durham, North Carolina who have been high utilizers of health care resources. PHC integrates available personalized health technologies, standards of care, and personalized health planning to serve as a model for rational health care delivery. Importantly, the PHC model of care will serve as a market for emerging predictive and personalized technologies to foster genomic medicine.",

        "abstract": "Human genetics research will be critical to the development of genetic profiles for personalized or precision medicine in asthma. Genetic profiles will consist of gene variants that predict individual disease susceptibility and risk for progression, predict which pharmaco- logic therapies will result in a maximal therapeutic benefit, and predict whether a therapy will result in an adverse response and should be avoided in a given individual. Pharmacogenetic studies of the glucocorticoid, leukotriene, and \u03b22 -adrenergic receptor pathways have focused on candidate genes within these pathways and, in addition to a small number of genome-wide association studies, have identified genetic loci associated with therapeutic responsiveness. This review summarizes these pharmacogenetic discoveries and the future of genetic profiles for personalized medicine in asthma. The benefit of a personalized, tailored approach to health care delivery is needed in the development of expensive biologic drugs directed at a specific biologic pathway. Prior pharmacogenetic discoveries, in combination with additional variants identified in future studies, will form the basis for future genetic profiles for personalized tailored approaches to maximize therapeutic benefit for an individual asthmatic while minimizing the risk for adverse events.

        "abstract": "Personalized medicine has been defined as the tailoring of medical treatment based on individual patient characteristics. In practice, personalized medicine generally involves the stratifying of patient populations based on biomarkers, most frequently genetic in nature. This results in patient subpopulations likely to show differential responses to drug therapy in terms of efficacy and toxicity. While the potential for personalized medicine to positively impact on drug discovery and therapeutics has been widely hyped, clinical uptake has been markedly limited. Over the recent years, a number of potential barriers to the more widespread uptake of personalized medicine have been identified. These include technical, economic and social factors. One such barrier is the need for the significant up-skilling of health professionals in order to harness the potential of personalized medicine and ensure adequate information flow to consumers. Pharmacists are ideally positioned to be active participants in personalized medicine but to date, their role has been minimal. While the reasons are multifactorial, we argue that there is a clear need for significant reforming of current pharmacy curricula. Here we review progress in worldwide pharmaceutical education and practice relevant to global personalized medicine and public health pharmacogenomics and highlight salient points for future consideration.

Although there is general agreement that personalized genomic medicine involves utilizing genome technology to assess individual risk and ensure the delivery of the \"right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time,\" different categories of stakeholders focus on different aspects of personalized genomic medicine and operationalize it in diverse ways. In order to move toward a clearer, more holistic understanding of the concept, this article begins by identifying and defining three major elements of personalized genomic medicine commonly discussed by stakeholders: molecular medicine, pharmacogenomics, and health information technology. The integration of these three elements has the potential to improve health and reduce health care costs, but it also raises many challenges. This article endeavors to address these challenges by identifying five strategic areas that will require significant investment for the successful integration of personalized genomics into clinical care: (1) health technology assessment; (2) health outcomes research; (3) education (of both health professionals and the public); (4) communication among stakeholders; and (5) the development of best practices and guidelines. While different countries and global regions display marked heterogeneity in funding of health care in the form of public, private, or blended payor systems, previous analyses of personalized genomic medicine and attendant technological innovations have been performed without due attention to this complexity. Hence, this article focuses on personalized genomic medicine in the United States as a model case study wherein a significant portion of health care payors represent private, nongovernment resources. Lessons learned from the present analysis of personalized genomic medicine could usefully inform health care systems in other global regions where payment for personalized genomic medicine will be enabled through private or hybrid public-private funding systems.",

We aimed to investigate whether personalized antiplatelet treatment in patients with high on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) improves clinical outcome. Platelet reactivity was assessed by adenosine diphosphate induced aggregation using a multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) in 798 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with HTPR received up to four repeated loading doses of clopidogrel or prasugrel in the personalized treatment group (n=403), while no change in the treatment strategy was undertaken in patients with HTPR in the non-personalized treatment group (n=395). There were fewer major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the personalized treatment group than in the non- personalized treatment group (7.4% vs. 15.3%; respectively; p<0.001). The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the relative risk to develop MACE was 51% lower in the personalized treatment group as compared to the non-personalized treatment group (HR=0.49; 95%CI: 0.31-0.77; p<0.001). Similarly, there was a clear net benefit of the personalized antiplatelet treatment over the non-personalized treatment (ischemic and bleedings events: 8.2% vs. 18.7%; respectively; HR=0.46; 95%CI: 0.29-0.70; p<0.001). Further analysis indicated that patients with aggregation values within the therapeutic window (21-49U) experienced the lowest event rates (stent thrombosis and major bleeding: 2.5%) as compared to poor responders (>50U: 5.4%) or ultra-responders (0-20U: 5.2%). In conclusion, personalized antiplatelet treatment improved patients outcome without increasing bleeding complications compared to the non-personalized treatment during a 12-month follow-up.",

However, there is little evidence evaluating the value of these new genomic technologies from the perspective of patients. As part of an ongoing effort to understand the continuum of the process of adoption of genomic diagnostics, our aim in this study was to examine the value of genomic diagnostics to breast and colorectal cancer patients, and their willingness to adopt and use genomic diagnostics. Patients & methods: We conducted six focus groups of breast and colorectal cancer patients from the oncology clinics at The Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA. An adapted Q-sort instrument was also administered to focus group participants. Results: The majority of breast and colorectal cancer patients are interested in using novel genomic diagnostics for deciding about treatment options. Most participants in our study expressed a willingness to pay out-of-pocket for genomic testing (z = 0.736). Reliability and validity of genomic testing were of significant concern (z = 1.32) for the majority of breast and colorectal cancer patients. Participants identified several facilitators and barriers within health systems that might either facilitate or impede the widespread adoption and use of genomic diagnostics in healthcare delivery. Conclusion: This study demonstrates breast and colorectal cancer patients' willingness to adopt and pay for novel genomic diagnostics, as well as identifies several salient factors associated with patient preferences for genomic diagnostics. \u00a9 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Pharmacogenomics (PG) has the potential to provide personalized therapy based on individual genetic variability in an effort to maximize efficacy and reduce adverse effects. The benefits of PG include improved therapeutic index, improved dose regimen, and selection of optimal types of drug for an individual or set of individuals. Advanced or metastatic breast cancer is typically treated with single or multiple combinations of chemotherapy regimens including anthracyclines, taxanes, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, platinum drugs, vinca alkaloids, and others. In this review, the PG of breast cancer therapeutics, including tamoxifen, which is the most widely used therapeutic for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer, is reviewed. The pharmacological activity of tamoxifen depends on its conversion by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to its abundant active metabolite, endoxifen. Patients with reduced CYP2D6 activity, as a result of either their genotype or induction by the coadministration of other drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 function, produce little endoxifen and hence derive limited therapeutic benefit from tamoxifen; the same can be said about the different classes of therapeutics in breast cancer. PG studies of breast cancer therapeutics should provide patients with breast cancer with optimal and personalized therapy.",

In clinical microbiology, the turnaround time of the diagnostic cycle (>24 hours) often leads to unnecessary suffering and deaths; approaches to relieve this burden include rapid diagnostic procedures and more efficient transmission or interpretation of molecular microbiology results. Although rapid nucleic acid-based diagnostic testing has demonstrated that it can impact on the transmission of hospital-acquired infections, we believe that such life-saving procedures should be performed closer to the patient, in dedicated 24/7 laboratories of healthcare institutions, or ideally at point of care. While personalized medicine generally aims at interrogating the genomic information of a patient, drug metabolism polymorphisms, for example, to guide drug choice and dosage, personalized medicine concepts are applicable in infectious diseases for the (rapid) identification of a disease-causing microbe and determination of its antimicrobial resistance profile, to guide an appropriate antimicrobial treatment for the proper management of the patient. The implementation of point-of-care testing for infectious diseases will require acceptance by medical authorities, new technological and communication platforms, as well as reimbursement practices such that time- and life-saving procedures become available to the largest number of patients.",

Thus far, seven co-developed drug-diagnostic combinations have been approved and several dozen post-hoc drug-diagnostic combinations (diagnostic approved after the drug).

We examine Medicare reimbursement in the U.S. of 10 drug-diagnostic combinations on the basis of a formulary review and a survey.\\n\\nFINDINGS: We found that payers reimburse all 10 drugs, but with variable and relatively high patient co-insurance, as well as imposition of formulary restrictions. Payer reimbursement of companion diagnostics is limited and highly variable. In addition, we found that the body of evidence on the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of therapeutics is thin and even less robust for diagnostics. Conclusions, discussion: The high cost of personalized therapeutics and dearth of evidence concerning the comparative clinical effectiveness of drug-diagnostic combinations appear to contribute to high patient cost sharing, imposition of formulary restrictions, and limited and variable reimbursement of companion diagnostics. Our findings point to the need to increase the evidence base supportive of establishing linkage between diagnostic testing and positive health outcomes.",

With recent emergence of targeted drugs, it was found that curative effects of the same targeted drugs in treating patients with the same tumor type even the same tumor pathological subtype but different therapeutic targets may be different. On the contrary, the curative effects of different targeted drugs in treating patients with different tumor types but the same therapeutic targets may be similar. Accordingly, the viewpoint of personalized therapy is advocated in Western medicine. Under the guidance of syndrome differentiation treatment in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), patients with the same tumor and different syndromes should be treated by different herbs, and patients with different tumor and the same syndrome should be treated by the same herbs. Both the theories of \"the same treatment for the same syndrome\" and \"the same treatment for the same therapeutic target\" indicate that personalized therapy in Western medicine is similar to TCM syndrome differentiation treatment. The article focuses on \"different treatments for the same disease\" as well as \"the same treatment for different diseases\" to describe the similar points between personalized therapy and TCM syndrome differentiation treatment and thereby proves that TCM syndrome differentiation treatment is a scientific and essential approach in treating tumor. At the same time, the article also points out the problems and solution methods of TCM syndrome differentiation treatment.",

Therefore, ways of helping people to overcome nicotine dependence are a key element of strategies aimed at improving public health. Current treatments are only partially effective and there is a need to develop more efficient approaches to help smokers to stop. There exists a substantial genetic variability in smoking behavior and the likelihood of cessation - tailoring treatment according to an individual's genetic profile is now technologically feasible and could lead to more successful cessation attempts. Here we review studies of the genetic effects on smoking cessation in randomized controlled trials of pharmacological therapy and discuss the potential value of a personalized approach to help people stop smoking.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive scientific progress in the melanoma field, treatment of advanced stage melanoma with chemotherapeutics and biotherapeutics has rarely provided response rates higher than 20%. In the past decade, targeted inhibitors have been developed for metastatic melanoma, leading to the advent of more personalized therapies of genetically characterized tumors. Here we review current melanoma treatments and emerging targeted molecular therapies. In particular we discuss the mutant BRAF inhibitors Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib, which markedly inhibit tumor growth and advance patients' overall survival. However this response is almost inevitably followed by complete tumor relapse due to drug resistance hampering the encouraging initial responses. Several mechanisms of resistance within and outside the MAPK pathway have now been uncovered and have paved the way for clinical trials of combination therapies to try and overcome tumor relapse. It is apparent that personalized treatment management will be required in this new era of targeted treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provide an easily accessible means of monitoring patient relapse and several new approaches are available for the molecular characterization of CTCs. Thus CTCs provide a monitoring tool to evaluate treatment efficacy and early detection of drug resistance in real time. We detail here how advances in the molecular analysis of CTCs may provide insight into new avenues of approaching therapeutic options that would benefit personalized melanoma management.",

This remarkable characteristic indicates that these models may be useful in the development of personalized medicine, which aims at finding treatment regimes that are appropriate for particular patients, not just appropriate for the average patient. In fact, published developments show that random-effects linear models may provide a solid theoretical framework for drug dosage individualization in chronic diseases. In particular, individualized dosages computed with these models by means of an empirical Bayesian approach may produce better results than dosages computed with some methods routinely used in therapeutic drug monitoring. This is further supported by published empirical and theoretical findings that show that random effects linear models may provide accurate representations of phase III and IV steady-state pharmacokinetic data, and may be useful for dosage computations. These models have applications in the design of clinical algorithms for drug dosage individualization in chronic diseases; in the computation of dose correction factors; computation of the minimum number of blood samples from a patient that are necessary for calculating an optimal individualized drug dosage in therapeutic drug monitoring; measure of the clinical importance of clinical, demographic, environmental or genetic covariates; study of drug-drug interactions in clinical settings; the implementation of computational tools for web-site-based evidence farming; design of pharmacogenomic studies; and in the development of a pharmacological theory of dosage individualization.",

Tooth loss trends are hypothesized to be greater in patients with more risk factors. Methods: DNA samples for 881 individuals were taken from the Dental Registry and DNA Repository at University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine. Clinical data for all 4137 subjects in the registry were also available. SNP genotyping was performed on the samples for IL1\u03b1 (rs1800587) and IL1\u03b2 (rs1143634). IL1 positive status was determined as having one or more of the recessive alleles for either SNP. Tooth loss status was determined based on dental records and data gathered for age, sex, ethnicity, and self-reported medical history. Various statistical analyses were performed on the data including genetic association analysis by the PLINK software, chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and ANOVA tests to determine significance. Results: Tooth loss averages increased with age by all risk factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and interleukin genotypes; p = 4.07E-13) and by number of risk factors (p = 0.006). Increased tooth loss is associated with age and number of risk factors including diabetes, tobacco use, IL1+, and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: These trends suggest that older patients and those with more risk factors should seek further preventive care to reduce future tooth loss.",

        "abstract": "Conventional cancer treatment modalities have several limitations including lack of sufficient efficacy, serious untoward toxicity, as well as innate and acquired drug resistance. In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FRalpha-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FRalpha tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FRalpha-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FRalpha. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRalpha-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRalpha expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors, indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FRalpha and FRbeta in complex with folates and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes cases worldwide have risen steadily over the past few decades, lending urgency to the search for more efficient, effective, and personalized ways to treat the disease. Current treatment strategies, however, may fail to maintain oscillations in blood glucose concentration that naturally occur multiple times per day, an important element of normal human physiology. Building upon recent successes in mathematical modeling of the human glucose-insulin system, we show that both food intake and insulin therapy likely demand increasingly precise control over insulin sensitivity if oscillations at a healthy average glucose concentration are to be maintained. We then model and describe personalized treatment options for patients with diabetes that maintain these oscillations. We predict that for a person with type II diabetes, both blood glucose levels can be controlled and healthy oscillations maintained when the patient gets an hour of daily exercise and is placed on a combination of Metformin and sulfonylurea drugs. We note that insulin therapy and an additional hour of exercise will reduce the patient[U+05F3]s need for sulfonylureas. Results of a modeling analysis suggest that, with constant nutrition and controlled exercise, the blood glucose levels of a person with type I diabetes can be properly controlled with insulin infusion between 0.45 and 0.7 ??U / ml min. Lastly, we note that all suggested strategies rely on existing clinical techniques and established treatment measures, and so could potentially be of immediate use in the design of an artificial pancreas. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

We aimed to investigate whether individualized antiplatelet treatment in clopidogrel non-responders is an effective and safe strategy. Methods: This was a prospective non-randomized non-blinded study comparing two cohorts (guided and non-guided treatment) with a follow-up of 1-month. Responsiveness to clopidogrel was assessed by multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) in 798 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In the guided group (n = 403) clopidogrel non-responders received repeated loading doses of clopidogrel or prasugrel, in the non-guided group (n = 395) clopidogrel non-responders did not undergo any change in treatment. Results: Stent thrombosis occurred significantly less often in the guided group than in the non-guided group (0.2% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.027). The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients in the non-guided group were at a 7.9-fold higher risk to develop stent thrombosis compared to the guided group (OR: 7.9; 95% CI: 1.08-69.2; p = 0.048). In line with this, acute coronary syndrome occurred significantly less often in the guided group than in the non-guided group (0% vs. 2.5%; p = 0.001) whereas there was no difference in the event rates of cardiac death (2% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.422) or major bleedings (1% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.186).

METHODS We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of 26 patients with gynecologic malignancies who underwent commercial tumor profiling at our institution during the first 18 months of test availability. Tumor profiles reported targeted therapies and clinical trials matched to patient-specific mutations. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics. RESULTS Most patients who underwent tumor profiling had serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma (46%). Patients underwent profiling after undergoing a median of two systemic therapies (range 0 to 13). A median of one targeted therapy was suggested per patient profile. Tumor profiling identified no clinically actionable mutations for seven patients (27%). Six patients sought insurance approval for a targeted therapy and two were declined (33%). One patient (4%) received a targeted therapy and this was discontinued due to tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS There are formidable barriers to targeted therapy for patients with gynecologic malignancies. These barriers include a dearth of FDA-approved targeted agents for gynecologic malignancies, lack of third party insurance coverage and limited geographic availability of clinical trials.",

Based on our modified basic virus infection model and a patient's clinic data, a mathematical model is set up in aim to explain the clinic data and predict the long time curative effect. Methods: The model is described by four variables: x, y, v, e represent uninfected cells, infected cells, free virus, and CTL cells, respectively. The equation includes 11 parameters: , a, beta, d, k, u, m, n, k<sub>1</sub> k<sub>2</sub> and k<sub>3</sub>. Here k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, and k<sub>3</sub> are the rate of CTL production and dead, killing virus, respectively. Results: The patients with HBV DNA levels less than 1000 copies/ml were reported in 17.5% (7/40). A patient whose HBV DNA levels were higher than 40000 copies/ml can keep treatment benefits even stopping the therapy for over ten weeks. The simulation data of our model are in agreement with the patient's HBV DNA data. Our simulation also shows that it needs to spend about 18 years for clearing all infected cells. Conclusion: The simulation result implies that some Chinese patients may need long term's therapy to clear all infected cells. Patients' CTLs assays are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the personalized modeling, and help doctors to decide whether stop the drug treatment even patients' HBV DNAs are higher than undetectable levels.",

We aimed to assess the utilization of cardiac monitoring in women with nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab-based chemotherapy in routine clinical practice. Patients & methods: The medical records of women continuously enrolled in a large national health insurance plan who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer and treated with trastuzumab from 2006 to 2008 were reviewed (n = 109). The primary outcome variables were the use and type of cardiac monitoring testing before and during trastuzumab therapy. An exploratory multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for receiving cardiac monitoring both at baseline and during trastuzumab treatment. Results: Monitoring both before and during therapy was less common (62%), although 74% had cardiac monitoring before therapy and 80% had at least one test during therapy. Radionuclide ventriculogram was utilized more often than echocardiography (48 vs 42%). Only the use of anthracycline (odds ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.01-5.71) was significantly associated with use of a cardiac monitoring both at baseline and during trastuzumab treatment.

Perhaps because of these historical underpinnings, there has been an intensive investigation of 'hepatic pharmacogenes' such as CYP450s and liver drug metabolism using pharmacogenomics approaches over the past five decades. Surprisingly, kidney pathophysiology, attendant diseases and treatment outcomes have been vastly under-studied and under-theorized despite their central importance in maintenance of health, susceptibility to disease and rational personalized therapeutics. Indeed, chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents an increasing public health burden worldwide, both in developed and developing countries. Patients with CKD suffer from high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which is mainly attributable to cardiovascular events before reaching end-stage renal disease. In this paper, we focus our analyses on renal function before end-stage renal disease, as seen through the lens of pharmacogenomics and human genomic variation. We herein synthesize the recent evidence linking selected Very Important Pharmacogenes (VIP) to renal function, blood pressure and salt-sensitivity in humans, and ways in which these insights might inform rational personalized therapeutics. Notably, we highlight and present the rationale for three applications that we consider as important and actionable therapeutic and preventive focus areas in renal pharmacogenomics: 1) ACE inhibitors, as a confirmed application, 2) VDR agonists, as a promising application, and 3) moderate dietary salt intake, as a suggested novel application. Additionally, we emphasize the putative contributions of gene-environment interactions, discuss the implications of these findings to treat and prevent hypertension and CKD. Finally, we conclude with a strategic agenda and vision required to accelerate advances in this under-studied field of renal pharmacogenomics with vast significance for global public health.",

Although several treatment options are currently available, variable efficacy and adherence results in many patients either not being treated or receiving inadequate treatment long term. Personalized treatment based on relevant patient characteristics may improve adherence to treatment and long-term clinical outcomes. Four key traits of upper airway anatomy and neuromuscular control interact to varying degrees within individuals to cause OSA. These are: 1) the pharyngeal critical closing pressure (Pcrit); 2) the stability of ventilator chemoreflex feedback control (loop gain); 2) the negative intra-esophageal pressure that triggers arousal (arousal threshold); and 4) the level of stimulus required to activated upper airway dilator muscles (upper airway recruitment threshold). Simplified diagnostic methods are being developed to assess these pathophysiological traits, potentially allowing prediction of which treatment would best suit each patient. In contrast to current practice of utilizing various treatment modes alone, model predictions and pilot clinical trials show improved outcomes by combining several treatments targeted to each patient's pathophysiology profile. These developments could theoretically improve efficacy and adherence to treatment, and in turn reduce the social and economic health burden of OSA and the associated life-threatening morbidities. This paper reviews OSA pathophysiology and identifies currently available and investigational treatments that may be combined in the future to optimize therapy based on individual profiles of key patient pathophysiological traits.",

The encouraging vision that is now being established is that we may move from trial and error therapies to evidence-based personalized medicine in clinical practice. However, research and the application of pharmacogenetics to clinical practice are believed to raise a host of controversial ethical issues. Some of these are related to the research process, for example, confidentiality and informed consent in association with human tissue sampling. Other issues arise on a societal level, for example, issues regarding justice and the use of race or ethnicity as proxies for genotyping. In this perspective, I comment on this debate and also suggest what we may learn from previous discussions regarding DNA testing and gene transfer methods. Arguably, the most important ethical perspective in medical research and drug development is related to the interests of patients wanting medical treatment that is both effective and carries low risks of adverse effects. Risk:benefit ratios must always be compared with existing alternatives, and while the risk of adverse effects may be tolerable for some individuals, owing to genetic reasons, this may not be relevant for others. This will have consequences for regulatory policies regarding drug development. In the future, personalized medicine will also need to take epigenetic and environmental factors into consideration.",

Two complementary computer tools have been developed to quantify the brace action on scoliotic spine from pressure measurements, and to simulate its effect on patient-adapted finite element model. Background. Brace pad forces and brace effect on spine deformities have been reported. However, the brace mechanisms still need to be better understood to obtain more effective treatments. Methods. The 3D geometry of the spine and rib cage of three scoliotic adolescents treated by the Boston brace was obtained using a multiview radiographic reconstruction technique. A personalized biomechanical model was constructed for each patient. Pressures generated by the brace on the thorax were measured using pressure sensors. For each zone with a threshold pressure higher than 30 mmHg, a total equivalent force was calculated and applied to the corresponding model nodes. Results. The pressure were generally scattered on the overall torso, with the highest pressures measured on five distinct regions: right thoracic, left lumbar, abdominal, right and left sides of the pelvis. The equivalent forces were of 18-73 N. Differences between simulated deformed shapes and real in-brace geometry of the patients were less than 6 and 9.8 mm for the vertebral positions in the coronal and sagittal planes, and 7.7?? for the Cobb angles.

Considering the diversity of immune responses against heterogeneous tumor cells, tailored selections of vaccine antigens appropriate for individual patients could be a rational approach for developing effective cancer vaccines. We have developed a novel immunotherapeutic approach called personalized peptide vaccine (PPV), in which a maximum of four human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched vaccine peptides were selected based on the pre-existing host immunity before vaccination. We conducted a series of phase I and phase II clinical trials of PPV, which have shown better antigen-specific immune responses and promising clinical outcomes in patients with various types of advanced cancers. Further randomized phase III trials would be recommended to prove the clinical benefits of PPV. In addition, novel biomarkers for selecting patients who would benefit most from PPV remain to be identified.",

        "abstract": "Background: Current technology permits an unbiased massive analysis of so-matic genetic alterations from tumor DNA as well as the generation of individu-alized mouse xenografts (Avatar models). This work aimed to evaluate our ex-perience integrating these two strategies to personalize the treatment of cancer patients. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing analysis of 25 patients with advanced solid tumors to identify putatively actionable tumor-specific genomic alterations. Avatar models were used as an in vivo platform to test proposed treatment strategies.\\n\\nRESULTS: Successful exome sequencing analyses has been obtained for 23 patients. Tumor specific mutations and copy number variations were identified All samples profiled contained relevant genomic alterations. Tumor was implanted to create an Avatar model from 14 patients and 10 succeeded. In occasions actionable alterations such as mutations in NF1, PI3KA and DDR2 failed to provide any benefit when a targeted drug was tested in the Avatar and accordingly treatment of the patients with these drugs was not effective. To date, 13 patients have received a personalized treatment and 6 achieved durable partial remissions. Prior testing of candidate treatments in Avatar models correlated with clinical response and helped to select empirical treatments in some patients with no actionable mutations.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The use of full genomic analysis for cancer care is promising but presents important challenges that will need to be solved for broad clinical application. Avatar models are a promising investigational platform for therapeutic decision making. While limitations still exist, this strategy should be further tested.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow transplantation is a form of cell therapy that has been in practice for decades for the treatment of hematological disorders and solid tumors. Immunosuppressive therapy has been a mainstay for treatment, but the severity of the adverse effects has made it an undesirable choice. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which reside in the vascular regions of the bone marrow, have been shown to serve as cellular support for the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. Furthermore, the immune suppressive properties of MSCs have been explored in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Thus, co-therapy with MSCs has been shown to facilitate engraftment of hematopoietic cells by suppressive graft versus host disease (GvHD). Although the mechanism by which MSCs suppress GvHD is unclear, the experimental evidence suggests that this partly occurs by modulation of immune response such as the induction of regulatory T cells. This paper discusses the role of MSCs as co-therapy for the future of stem cell transplantation, with the overarching theme of personalized medicine for cell-based health interventions.",

        "abstract": "The main goal of pharmacogenomics is to study the effects of genetic variation on patient responses to therapies. Its applications range from the evaluation of safety and efficacy of treatment to the optimization of therapies and therapeutic regimens. Pharmacogenomics is becoming increasingly important in immunology, for the development of new generation vaccines, immunotherapies and transplantation. The human immune system is a complex and adaptive learning system which operates at multiple levels: molecules, cells, organs, organisms, and groups of organisms. Immunologic research, both basic and applied, needs to deal with this complexity. We increasingly use mathematical modeling and computational simulation in the study of the immune system and immune responses. Thus, quantitative models that appropriately capture the complexity in architecture and function of the immune system are an integral component of the personalized medicine efforts. In silico models of the immune system can provide answers to a variety of questions, including understanding the general behavior of the immune system, the course of disease, effects of treatment, analysis of cellular and molecular interactions, and simulation of laboratory experiments. We herein present the ImmunoGrid project that integrates molecular and system level models of the immune system and processes for in silico studies of the immune function. The ImmunoGrid simulator uses Grid technologies, enabling computational simulation of the immune system at the natural scale, perform a large number of simulated experiments, capture the diversity of the immune system between individuals, and provide a basis for therapeutic approaches tailored to the individual genetic make-up.",

        "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are some of the most widely prescribed medications worldwide and have been shown to be effective at lowering cholesterol in numerous long-term prospective trials, yet there are significant limitations to their use. First, patients receiving statin therapy have relatively low levels of medication adherence compared with other drug classes. Next, numerous statin formulations are available, each with its own unique safety and efficacy profile, and it may be unclear to prescribers which treatment is optimal for their patients. Finally, statins have class-wide side effects of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis that have resulted in a product recall and dosage limitations. Recent evidence suggests that two genomic markers, KIF6 and SLCO1B1, may inform the therapy choice of patients initiating statins. Given the prevalence of statin usage, their potential health advantages and their overall cost to the healthcare system, there could be significant clinical benefit from creating personalized treatment regimens. Ultimately, if this approach is effective it may encourage higher adoption of generic statins when appropriate, promote adherence, lower rates of myopathy, and overall achieve higher value cardiovascular care. This paper will review the evidence for personalized prescribing of statins via KIF6 and SLCO1B1 and consider some of the implications for testing these markers as part of routine clinical care.",

However, AED treatment is often problematic because of unpredictability of drug response, adverse drug reactions and optimal dosing in individual patients. Moreover, up to one in three patients with epilepsy are refractory to currently available AEDs. Pharmacogenetic studies explore the contribution of genetic variants to interindividual differences in drug response. An increasing number of pharmacogenetic association studies in epilepsy are being reported. Nevertheless, at present only one association is firmly established, namely that of the HLA-B*1502 allele with severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions on carbamazepine therapy in the Han Chinese population. It is likely that large collaborations looking at multiple genes encoding entire drug pathways, or even the entire human genome, together with new pharmacogenetic strategies will result in the discovery of other genetic variants involved in AED response. Although several challenges remain, it is hoped that, ultimately, these findings will lead to the development of predictive tests, resulting in a more efficacious and safer AED treatment and to the development of new AEDs with novel mechanisms of action, particularly aimed at patients with drug-refractory epilepsy.

Over the last eight years, this paradigm of care has been shifting towards the use of molecularly targeted agents. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have emerged as an important biomarker for these targeted agents and multiple studies have shown that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that inhibit EGFR are superior to traditional chemotherapy in patients possessing an EGFR mutation. Nationally funded health care systems face a number of challenges in implementing these targeted therapies, most related to the need to test for biomarkers that predict likelihood of benefiting from the drug. These obstacles include the challenge of getting a large enough tissue sample, workload of involved specialists, reliability of subtyping in NSCLC, differences in biomarker tests, and the disconnect between the funding of drugs and the related biomarker test. In order to improve patient outcomes, in a national healthcare system, there is a need for governments to accept the changing paradigm, invest in technology and build capacity for molecular testing to facilitate the implementation of improved patient care.",

ATLL is a neoplasm of mature CD4+ T-cell origin known to be resistant to standard anti-cancer therapies. Based on ATLL research performed in our laboratory as well as other reports, we discuss diagnostic, predictive, and pharmacological biomarkers for companion diagnostics, which are vital factors for personalized oncology. From the viewpoint of resistance to apoptosis, the FAS ligand/FAS system, TRAIL/TRAIL receptor system, and survivin are promising targets for cancer therapy. The tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a, p14ARF, and p53 are well known predictive and pharmacological biomarkers for various cancers as well as for ATLL. We have found that the plasma miRNAs miR-155 and miR-126 have importance as novel biomarkers to evaluate disease progression and prognosis in ATLL patients. Furthermore, ATLL is considered an appropriate target disease for epigenetic therapy. Although several molecular diagnostic methods for cancer have been approved over the past decade, only a small number of predictive biomarkers have been shown to have clinical value. In a review of our ATLL research findings, we have noticed the same trend in our search for an improved biomarker, and thus the discovery of a highly precise biomarker is one of the keys for the development of superior companion diagnostics.",

This article first gives a brief overview of selected diagnostics R&D studies in Taiwan for antipsychotic treatments, antidepressant responsiveness, sibutramine therapy, chronic hepatitis C therapy, and other various treatments of significance for public health in Taiwan, with consideration of genetic and genomic variants. For example, the interactions of two insulin-induced gene (INSIG) biomarkers, designated INSIG1 and INSIG2, were found to be associated with metabolic syndrome in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. Recent advances in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine studies conducted in Taiwanese populations and attendant novel computational approaches are highlighted here, with a view to public and population health in the country and the Asia-Pacific region where there are extensive investments in genomics and postgenomics diagnostics R&D. Finally, we address a discussion of future directions and some of the most pressing computational challenges in data-intensive life sciences owing to the combinatorial explosion of ever larger data sets.

        "abstract": "The incorporation of individualized molecular therapeutics into routine clinical practice for both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma are amongst the most significant advances of the last decades in medical oncology. In NSCLC activating somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene have been found to be predictive of a response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib or gefitinib. More recently the EML4-ALK fusion gene which occurs in 3-5% of NSCLC has been found to predict sensitivity to crizotinib an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase. Similarly in melanoma, 50% of cases have BRAF mutations in exon 15 mostly V600E and these cases are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib. In a Phase III study of advanced melanoma cases with this mutation vemurafenib improved survival from 64% to 84% at 6 months, when compared with dacarbazine. In both NSCLC and melanoma clinical benefit is not obtained in patients without these genomic changes, and moreover in the case of vemurafenib the therapy may theoretically induce proliferation of cases of melanoma without BRAF mutations. An emerging clinical challenge is that of acquired resistance after initial responses to targeted therapeutics. Resistance to the TKI's in NSCLC is most frequently due to acquisition of secondary mutations within the tyrosine kinase of the EGFR or alternatively activation of alternative tyrosine kinases such as C-MET. Mechanisms of drug resistance in melanoma to vemurafenib do not involve mutations in BRAF itself but are associated with a variety of molecular changes including RAF1 or COT gene over expression, activating mutations in RAS or increased activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRbeta. Importantly these data support introducing re-biopsy of tumors at progression to continue to personalize the choice of therapy throughout the patient's disease course. \u00a92012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Many diagnostic entities hat were traditionally viewed as individual diseases are heterogeneous in their molecular pathogenesis and treatment responsiveness. This results in the treatment of many patients with ineffective drugs, incursion of substantial medical costs for the treatment of patients who do not benefit and the conducting of large clinical trials to identify small, average treatment benefits for heterogeneous groups of patients. In oncology, new genomic technologies provide powerful tools for the selection of patients who require systemic treatment and are most (or least) likely to benefit from a molecularly targeted therapeutic. In the large amount of literature on biomarkers, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion regarding the specifics involved in the development and evaluation of prognostic and predictive biomarker diagnostics. There is a lack of appreciation that the development of drugs with companion diagnostics increases the complexity of clinical development. Adapting to the fundamental importance of tumor heterogeneity and achieving the benefits of personalized oncology for patients and healthcare costs will require paradigm changes for clinical and statistical investigators in academia, industry and regulatory agencies.

In addition to a significant effect of NRT compared with placebo across time periods, analyses revealed a significant genotype x treatment interaction at 12-week follow-up, such that participants who were homozygous for the A allele were more likely to report smoking abstinence in the NRT condition versus placebo compared with carriers of the G allele. These results did not persist after NRT was discontinued, although its temporal contiguity to treatment suggests it is a true pharmacogenetic effect. Importantly, these findings stand in contrast to previous research in the field. Moreover, the study reported provocative interactions between gender and \u03bc-opioid receptor gene status with regard to long-term treatment outcome, and between abstinence and gender with regard to changes in body mass index.

We aim to improve the predictive accuracy of genotyping by developing models that also incorporate certain non-genetic factors. Study selection and results: The anti-coagulant warfarin is widely used to prevent venous thromboembolic events. Although frequent monitoring of the prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) allows an appropriate maintenance dose to be obtained for most individuals, there are some individuals for whom it is difficult to achieve the target PT-INR even when warfarin dose is increased. The anti-platelet drug clopidogrel is typically used with aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the existence of clopidogrel resistance is a major concern in Asian populations owing to the high prevalence of deficient allele of the CYP2C19 gene, which encodes a major enzyme that produces the active metabolite. Individual response to these anti-thrombotic drugs cannot be accurately predicted based on genetic factors alone. We have constructed two algorithms, one that predicts the maintenance dose of warfarin and one that estimates individual responses to clopidogrel in outpatients without a device-based platelet function test. We applied Akaike's Information Criterion to evaluate the validity of these algorithms. Conclusions: In addition to genotyping data, inter-individual variation in non-genetic factors, such as clinical laboratory data, should be considered to predict drug response more accurately in each individual.",

This principle has been recognized and adhered by TCM clinical practitioners for thousands of years. However, the underlying mechanisms of TCM personalized medicine are not fully investigated so far and remained unknown. This paper discusses framework of TCM personalized medicine in classic literatures and in real-world clinical settings, and investigates the underlying mechanisms of TCM personalized medicine from the perspectives of network medicine. Based on 246 well-designed outpatient records on insomnia, by evaluating the personal biases of manifestation observation and preferences of herb prescriptions, we noted significant similarities between each herb prescriptions and symptom similarities between each encounters. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of TCM personalized medicine, we constructed a clinical phenotype network (CPN), in which the clinical phenotype entities like symptoms and diagnoses are presented as nodes and the correlation between these entities as links. This CPN is used to investigate the promiscuous boundary of syndromes and the co-occurrence of symptoms. The small-world topological characteristics are noted in the CPN with high clustering structures, which provide insight on the rationality of TCM personalized diagnosis and treatment. The investigation on this network would help us to gain understanding on the underlying mechanism of TCM personalized medicine and would propose a new perspective for the refinement of the TCM individualized clinical skills.",

Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been studied for association with antipsychotic-induced weight gain in an attempt to find genetic predictors of this side effect. An ability to predict this side effect could lead to personalized treatment plans for predisposed individuals, which could significantly decrease the prevalence and severity of weight gain. Variations in the serotonin receptor 2c gene (HTR2C) have emerged as promising candidates for prediction of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Specifically, the well-studied -759C/T promoter polymorphism has been associated with weight gain in diverse populations, although some studies have reported no association. This discrepancy is likely due to heterogeneity in study design with respect to ethnicity, treatment duration, and other variables. Notably, the association between HTR2C and antipsychotic-induced weight gain appears strongest in short-term studies on patients with limited or no previous antipsychotic treatment. Other, less extensively studied promoter polymorphisms (-697C/G, -997G/A, and -1165A/G) have also emerged as potential predictors of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Conversely, the well-studied intronic polymorphism Cys23Ser does not appear to be associated. With further research on both HTR2C and other genetic and environmental predictors of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, a predictive test could one day be created to screen patients and provide preventative or alternative treatment for those who are predisposed to this serious side effect.",

Analyses of tissue microarrays were previously limited by semiquantitative protein expression analysis using brown stain (chromagen-based) methods. These methods are imperfect for protein expression analyses because of a smaller dynamic range and decreased ability for multiplexing many markers, as compared with objective in situ quantitation of protein expression in tumor samples with fluorescence microscopy by a new technology called Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA\u2122). By using AQUA analysis, tissue microarrays can serve a unique role as both a discovery tool and as a validation tool for nucleic-acid expression profiling-based target discoveries with results equivalent to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitation. The identification of novel prognostic markers can identify subsets of patients at high or low risk upon diagnosis, as well as new targets for potential future therapeutic development or metastatic disease treatment decisions. Thus, AQUA provides an unparalleled opportunity to advance personalized medicine through its ability to multiplex, quantitate and localize in situ protein expression",

Nowgen, a center for genetics in healthcare, is dedicated to exploring how health service research, practice and innovation, in relation to genetic medicine, are informed and perceived by the public. In 2006, Nowgen commissioned a national polling organization, ICM, to carry out a representative survey of UK public attitudes to key questions related to genetic medicine, in order to help inform its future activity. The survey indicated that the UK public is relatively well informed about the contribution made by genes to common and complex disease and that it is fairly optimistic about the role of genetics in the treatment of a range of medical conditions.

        "abstract": "The analysis of complex diseases was revolutionized by the ability to genotype at a genome-wide level tagging common SNPs in sufficiently large, and therefore adequately powered, population sample sets. This technological breakthrough has led to thousands of genetic variants being robustly associated with a multitude of phenotypic traits. These findings have illuminated novel genes and previously unknown pathways in the pathogenesis of disease, although in the majority of loci the functional mechanism remains unknown. The integration of this genomic information with epigenomic and transcriptomic data from these regions is one of the next steps in unraveling their biological significance. Allele-specific methylation influences allele-specific expression; therefore, the methylation state of the haplotypes within genetically associated regions can determine epigenetic differences with potential functional effects. DNA methylation data and association-determined risk and nonrisk haplotypes can be compared by a haplotype-specific methylation analysis. These are the first forays into what will become an increasingly routine multidimensional analysis as whole-genome, epigenome and transcriptome sequencing data become easily obtainable, with existing second- and soon to be available third-generation sequencing analyzers. Concise understanding of the functional implications of these genome-wide association-derived risk factors, plus rare variants discovered from deep sequencing experiments currently underway, will enable personalized risk and prevention profiling, as well as treatment, to come to fruition. 2011 Future Medicine Ltd",

        "abstract": "Mobility impairments due to injury or disease have a significant impact on quality of life. Consequently, development of effective treatments to restore or replace lost function is an important societal challenge. In current clinical practice, a treatment plan is often selected from a standard menu of options rather than customized to the unique characteristics of the patient. Furthermore, the treatment selection process is normally based on subjective clinical experience rather than objective prediction of post-treatment function. The net result is treatment methods that are less effective than desired at restoring lost function. This paper discusses the possible use of personalized neuromusculoskeletal computer models to improve customization, objectivity, and ultimately effectiveness of treatments for mobility impairments. The discussion is based on information gathered from academic and industrial research sites throughout Europe, and both clinical and technical aspects of personalized neuromusculoskeletal modeling are explored. On the clinical front, we discuss the purpose and process of personalized neuromusculoskeletal modeling, the application of personalized models to clinical problems, and gaps in clinical application. On the technical front, we discuss current capabilities of personalized neuromusculoskeletal models along with technical gaps that limit future clinical application. We conclude by summarizing recommendations for future research efforts that would allow personalized neuromusculoskeletal models to make the greatest impact possible on treatment design for mobility impairments.",

Materials & methods: Members of several relevant medical organizations in Australia and New Zealand were invited via email to participate in an online survey. Results: A total of 149 respondents, including 40 surgeons, 46 oncologists and 63 breast care nurses, completed the online questionnaire. The majority of respondents believed that TFGT was useful for patient care (87.3%) and valuable for the treatment and management of breast cancer (90.6%). In multivariable analyses, breast care nurses were significantly more likely to agree that TFGT was useful for patient care and the treatment and management of breast cancer compared with oncologists and surgeons (= 0.30; 95% CI: 0.01-0.60; p = 0.045). Participants also agreed that TFGT has an impact on treatment decision-making (96.0%), uptake of bilateral mastectomy (98.7%) and uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (98.0%) in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. A slight preference towards surgeons (49.7%) as the best health professional to make the initial offer of TFGT was observed and the majority of respondents suggested the best time to offer TFGT was shortly after diagnosis, when the treatment plan is discussed. Conclusion: The findings suggest health professionals have positive attitudes towards TFGT. Future training programs focusing on teamwork models and guidelines specifying health professionals roles in regards to TFGT and follow-up management may be of benefit. \u00a9 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",

The mapping of the human genome and subsequent advancements in genetic technology had raised the public expectation that personalized drug therapy would come sooner than later. However, with barriers and logistical challenges existing at multiple levels, achieving this goal remains years away. Knowledge gap in healthcare professionals has always been cited as a significant barrier in clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics. Yet, to overcome the spectrum of challenges and for personalized medicine to succeed, there needs to be a rethinking of expanding the educational scope to include all stakeholders within the personalized medicine innovation ecosystem, rather than \"narrowly\" focusing on simply educating current and future health practitioners. Personalized medicine can only be achieved with all stakeholders in the field, under the rubric of a vision of a \"knowledge ecosystem\", working together, and occasionally accepting a paradigm change in their current approaches to implementation. If postgenomics personalized medicine is to embrace systems pharmacology as a core tenet, it seems essential that such broader vision should be extended to field of education as well.

        "abstract": "Nutrition research has traditionally focused on providing adequate amounts of nutrients to nourish populations and prevent nutrient deficiencies. Modern nutrition science explores health-related aspects of bioactive components in foodstuffs at a subgroup rather than population level. Today's nutrition research focuses on promoting health, preventing or delaying the onset of disease, optimizing performance and assessing risk in individuals or subpopulations. Personalized nutrition means adapting food to individual needs, depending on host biological variation as well as life stage, style and situation. Nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics comprise the science to understand human genomic/genetic variability in preferences, requirements, and responses to diet and may become the future tools for personalized nutrition, health maintenance and disease prevention. The novel field of nutriproteomics builds upon and complements the field of nutrigenomics/nutrigenetics. Nutriproteomics has great potential as a tool for personalized nutrition. Specifically, nutriproteomics delivers two essential outputs for molecular nutrition research and applications in personalized nutrition: (1) the characterization and quantification of food-derived bioactive peptides and proteins and (2) the elucidation of biomarkers for mechanism-of-action, efficacy and side effects of nutritional interventions. This article introduces the new field of nutriproteomics in the context of nutrition and health research and discusses protein- and peptide-derived bioactives and biomarkers, highlights human proteome variability and how best to translate this field into personalized nutrition. The paper concludes with a status quo and outlook on nutriproteomics studies and technologies. \u00a9 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In theory, the introduction of a novel test to accompany a therapy should be simple and automatic. However, In reality, the marriage of a test with therapy will not be a simple one, since each industry operates with its own distinct business model. Of concern to the pharmaceutical industry is the potential commercial dependency of a drug on the performance and implementation of a diagnostic. These concerns are justified since the history of diagnostic tests is frequently one of under use. One of the factors cited by Rogers is the issue of how complex an innovation is to administer. Rogers demonstrates that an innovation that is difficult to administer will be implemented more slowly or be discontinued by the user group it was intended for. It is the author's view that understanding this micro interaction, experience and barriers of testing with the individual provider, in short the complexity of the test, will, in turn, provide those in the pharmaceutical industry with a methodology to consider their risk or exposure to a test upon which their therapy may become dependent in the US market. Since personalized medicine significantly marries the test and treatment decision, it is the perspective of the provider that will be paramount in determining which, if any, test is ordered and the subsequent clinical decision he or she is enabled to take upon the test response. Therefore, a focus of this perspective is to consider the issues of test implementation from the perspective of the US provider who will order and use the information they provide. The Opportunity To Test Index methodology is introduced, which the authors speculate may help quantify the level of risk a pharmaceutical company has to the complexity of a test upon which its therapy will be dependent. The methodology scores five key elements impacting test implementation: reimbursement, turnaround time, test administration, test interpretation and patient engagement.",

They constitute a major cause of iatrogenic accidents because of their narrow therapeutic index and consequently increase both thrombotic and bleeding risk; thus, regular monitoring is required. Patient and environmental factors affect the anticoagulation response and it has become evident that the wide interindividual variation in AVK response is also partly genetically determined. The main enzyme responsible for the metabolism of AVKs is hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP2C9. Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit I (VKORC1) is a key enzyme in the vitamin K cycle; it is required to regenerate the cofactor essential for the activation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and is the target enzyme of AVK inhibition. Genetic variations affecting both CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are associated with variability in drug response and may explain differences in dose requirements. Genotyping for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants before initiation of treatment could allow clinicians to develop dosing protocols and identify patients at higher risk for AVK complications such as bleeding.",

Respondents answered several closed-ended survey items addressing beliefs regarding what influences a smoker's ability to quit, past pharmacotherapy use, and their willingness to undergo genetic assessment in order to be matched to optimal treatment, among other items.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this first nationally representative survey of US smokers, 77% of respondents expressed willingness to undergo genetic testing in order to be matched to optimal pharmacotherapy, yet only 18% had ever used pharmacotherapy in a previous quit attempt. Smokers who rated 'medications and counseling' as very important in quitting were significantly more likely to endorse genetic testing (odds ratio [OR]: 8.94; 95% CI: 1.86-43.06), while those rating 'having God's help' as very important were significantly less likely to express willingness to undergo testing (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.71). African American smokers were more likely than white smokers to express willingness to undergo genetic testing (OR: 3.80; 95% CI: 1.09-13.22), despite lower rates of previous pharmacotherapy use.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: While smokers reported high rates of willingness to undergo genetic testing to be matched to optimal treatment, these results suggest that smokers' willingness to use medications indicated by genetic test results may prove a significant barrier to realizing the promise of tailored smoking cessation treatment.

To overcome these barriers and bring FHH to the forefront of the personalized medicine effort, we developed the genomic medicine model (GMM) for primary care. The GMM, founded upon the principles of the Health Belief Model, Adult Learning Theory and the implementation sciences, shifts responsibility for FHH onto the patient, uses information technology (MeTree\u00a9) for risk stratification and interpretation, and provides education across multiple levels for each stakeholder, freeing up the clinical encounter for discussion around personalized preventive healthcare plans. The GMM has been implemented and optimized as part of an implementation-effectiveness hybrid pilot study for breast/ovarian cancer, colon cancer and thrombosis, and risk for hereditary cancer syndromes in two primary care clinics in NC, USA. This paper describes the conceptual development of the model and key findings relevant for broader uptake and sustainability in the primary care community. \u00a9 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Although most opioid addiction treatment is provided in specialty programs (i.e., methadone treatment clinics), the growing use of buprenorphine by physicians in office-based settings is increasing access to treatments. The widespread use of buproprion in primary care settings for smoking cessation is another example of how the boundaries of addiction treatment have expanded. Medication-assisted treatment of AUDs is consistent with treatment of other chronic disorders such as diabetes or hypertension. Long-term, perhaps indefinite, use of medication for patient stabilization is reasonable. Medication for AUDs may be employed indefinitely or intermittently along with interventions aimed at changing lifestyle practices to sustain recovery.

Although the rate of gastric cancer has declined dramatically over the past decades in most developed Western countries, it has not declined in East Asia. Currently, a radical gastrectomy is still the only curative treatment for gastric cancer. Over the last twenty years, however, surgery alone has been replaced by a multimodal perioperative approach. To achieve the maximum benefit from the perioperative treatment, a thorough evaluation of the tumor must first be performed. A complete assessment of gastric cancer is divided into two parts: staging and histology. According to the stage and histology of the cancer, perioperative chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy can be implemented, and perioperative targeted therapies such as trastuzumab may also play a role in this field. However, perioperative treatment approaches have not been widely accepted until a series of clinical trials were performed to evaluate the value of perioperative treatment. Although multimodal perioperative treatment has been widely applied in clinical practice, personalization of perioperative treatment represents the next stage in the treatment of gastric cancer.

        "abstract": "Across the translational research continuum from biomarker discovery to public health research, \"cost-effectiveness\" considerations are crucial, and can significantly impact the adoption of personalized medicine innovations. Cost-effectiveness is concerned with providing evidence to compare the (economic) costs and the health outcomes of competing health interventions or technologies. This also affects translational research in all stages, including clinical trials, post-market monitoring and population health outcome assessment. Indeed, economic considerations are important in determining the development and diffusion of a new technology in any scientific field. This is particularly true in healthrelated sectors, wherein governments and regulatory agencies with a mandate and commitment to efficient and rational allocation of resources require transparent and rigorous economic evidence to support or decline the adoption of a new technology. In the context of personalized medicine and theragnostics (i.e., the fusion of therapeutics and diagnostics), the use of genomics in clinical practice can be markedly facilitated by tandem evaluation of the clinical benefits/risks of customized health interventions and their cost-effectiveness. This paper provides a synthesis of the past and emerging literature on cost-effectiveness studies that evaluate pharmacogenetics tests. We conclude that despite the recent efforts, there is still a scarcity of convincing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of genomics products that creates a barrier in the uptake of pharmacogenetics in personalized medicine. Additionally, the reasons that limit a wider development of the cost-effectiveness analyses in this field are discussed, with a view to amend the above translational gaps in the literature. 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd",

Today, the core elements of that vision are widely accepted and have been articulated in a series of recent reports by the US Institute of Medicine. Systems approaches to biology and medicine are now beginning to provide patients, consumers and physicians with personalized information about each individual's unique health experience of both health and disease at the molecular, cellular and organ levels. This information will make disease care radically more cost effective by personalizing care to each person's unique biology and by treating the causes rather than the symptoms of disease. It will also provide the basis for concrete action by consumers to improve their health as they observe the impact of lifestyle decisions. Working together in digitally powered familial and affinity networks, consumers will be able to reduce the incidence of the complex chronic diseases that currently account for 75% of disease-care costs in the USA.",

The degree and severity of EARR associated with orthodontic treatment are multifac- torial, involving host and environmental factors. Genetic factors account for at least 50% of the variation in EARR. Variation in the Interleukin 1 beta gene in orthodontically treated individuals accounts for 15% of the variation in EARR. Historical and con- temporary evidence implicates injury to the periodontal ligament and supporting structures at the site of root compression fol- lowing the application of orthodontic force as the earliest event leading to EARR. Decreased IL-1? production in the case of IL- 1B (+3953) allele 1 may result in relatively less catabolic bone modeling (resorption) at the cortical bone interface with the PDL, which may result in prolonged stress concentrated in the root of the tooth, triggering a cascade of fatigue-related events lead- ing to root resorption. One mechanism of action for EARR may be mediated through impairment of alveolar resorption, result- ing in prolonged stress and strain of the adjacent tooth root due to dynamic functional loads. Future estimation of susceptibil- ity to EARR will likely require the analysis of a suite of genes, root morphology, skeleto-dental values, and the treatment method to be used\u2014or essentially the amount of tooth movement planned for treatment.",

Scientific and technological advances in genetic testing, as with any newly introduced medical technology, present certain challenges to existing frameworks of oversight. In addition, the growing use of genetic testing will require a significant investment in evidence-based assessments to understand the validity and utility of these tests in clinical and personal decisionmaking. To optimize the use of genetic testing in healthcare, all sectors of the oversight system need to be strengthened and yet remain flexible in order to adapt to advances that will inevitably increase the range of genetic tests and methodologies.",

Gene diet interactions that affect metabolic pathways relevant to disease risk are continuously being uncovered. Discoveries in the field of nutrigenomics demonstrate that some individuals may benefit from adhering to different dietary guidelines than others, depending on their genotype. Certain industries have already begun to capitalize on the anticipation that knowledge of genomic information could help prevent the risk of developing diseases. Although disclosure of genetic information has been associated with the adoption of positive health-related behaviors under certain circumstances, the effect of providing gene-based dietary advice on motivating adherence to favorable dietary changes is largely unknown.",

After two visits, patients were randomized to one of four sequences. The main outcome was BP differences between the active treatment and placebo. Results. One hundred and twenty-four patients were randomised: mean age 53, men 65%, family history of hypertension 60%. Average BP fall at each visit before randomisation was about 2% of the initial level reflecting both a regression to the mean and a placebo effect. Conclusion. The results are expected to improve knowledge in drug's mechanisms of action and pathophysiology of hypertension, and to help in personalizing treatment.

Inflammation is associated with AD, and is predictive of more advanced disease pathology and cognitive impairment. Moreover, preventing inflammation reduces the risk of developing AD. However, clinical trials with anti-inflammatory treatment have not been successful. One reason may be that there is diversity in the immune response and reducing immune activity with anti-inflammatories is not appropriate in all conditions. Recently, we have begun to apply categorizations, used to characterize the peripheral immune response, to the immune processes of the brain. When we do this, we are able to describe an individual's inflammatory profile within this spectrum. We have observed that patients with early AD are distributed across two broad categories of immune activation. If we recognize the diversity within this cohort of individuals with early AD and use information about immune phenotypes to guide the choice of treatment, then we may expect better clinical outcomes. \u00a9 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Since that time, Myriad has been a forerunner in the field of personalized medicine through the use of effective commercialization strategies which have been emulated by other commercial biotechnology companies. Myriad's strategies include patent acquisition and active enforcement, direct-to-consumer advertising, diversification, and trade secrets. These business models have raised substantial ethical controversy and criticism, often related to the company's focus on market dominance and the potential conflict between private sector profitability and the promotion of public health. However, these strategies have enabled Myriad to survive the economic challenges that have affected the biotechnology sector and to become financially successful in the field of personalized medicine. Our critical assessment of the legal, economic and ethical aspects of Myriad's practices over this period allows the identification of the company's more effective business models. It also discusses of the consequences of implementing economically viable models without first carrying out broader reflection on the socio-cultural, ethical and political contexts in which they would apply.",

Considering the increasing number of treatment options, ranging from best supportive care to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), decision making is rather complex in this cohort of patients. Moreover, aspects of the aging process also have to be considered in therapy planning. Treatment of elderly MDS patients is dependent on the patient's individual risk and prognosis. Comorbidities play an essential role as predictors of survival and therapy tolerance. Age-adjusted models and the use of geriatric assessment scores are described as a basis for individualized treatment algorithms. Specific treatment recommendations for the different groups of patients are given. Currently available therapeutic agents, including supportive care, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), immune-modulating agents, hypomethylating agents, and HSCT are described in detail and discussed with a special focus on elderly MDS patients. The inclusion of elderly patients in clinical trials is of utmost importance to obtain data on efficacy and safety in this particular group of patients. Endpoints relevant for the elderly should be integrated, including maintenance of quality of life and functional activities as well as evaluation of use of healthcare resources.",

        "abstract": "Among the most important innovations within the psychotherapeutic care system are the new opportunities in the field of e-mental health. During the past decade, Internet-based and other e-mental health approaches for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and related stress-associated symptoms have been developed in great variety. Solely Internet-based self-help programs are the lowest-threshold approaches in a stepped-care system. By contrast, individualized online psychotherapy and virtual reality programs are at the opposite pole of the spectrum. Approaches in the field of m(obile)-mental health complement these new developments in psychotherapy. The existing evidence supports the clinical efficacy of all the described approaches, although not all have been tested rigorously analog to phase\u00a0III studies in psychopharmacology. Nonetheless, e-mental health approaches will shape our field more and more in the future.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although placing patients with acute respiratory failure in a prone (face down) position improves their oxygenation 60 to 70 percent of the time, the effect on survival is not known. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized trial, we compared conventional treatment (in the supine position) of patients with acute lung injury or the acute respiratory distress syndrome with a predefined strategy of placing patients in a prone position for six or more hours daily for 10 days. We enrolled 304 patients, 152 in each group. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 23.0 percent during the 10-day study period, 49.3 percent at the time of discharge from the intensive care unit, and 60.5 percent at 6 months. The relative risk of death in the prone group as compared with the supine group was 0.84 at the end of the study period (95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.27), 1.05 at the time of discharge from the intensive care unit (95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.32), and 1.06 at six months (95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.28). During the study period the mean (+/-SD) increase in the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, measured each morning while patients were supine, was greater in the prone than the supine group (63.0+/-66.8 vs. 44.6+/-68.2, P=0.02). The incidence of complications related to positioning (such as pressure sores and accidental extubation) was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although placing patients with acute respiratory failure in a prone position improves their oxygenation, it does not improve survival.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics promises to improve therapeutic care by providing the right drug and dosage to the appropriate patient. Despite widespread interest in personalized medicine, the implementation of clinical pharmacogenomics has been slow. The major issue for clinicians is the lack of evidence that pharmacogenomic testing improves clinical outcomes and that testing is cost effective. Only a few randomized clinical trials comparing pharmacogenetics testing with standard protocols have been conducted. The few studies that are available have either been underpowered or demonstrated only modest benefits. Nevertheless, if clinical decisions are made regarding therapeutic selection and dosing, pharmacogenomic testing may be justified. Issues for the clinical laboratories (who are responsible for providing pharmacogenomic services) to consider, include the availability of the US FDA-cleared tests, the absence of reimbursement codes, the need for genotyping accuracy and the need to find clinical expertise to interpret laboratory results. From the clinical laboratory perspective, testing can be better implemented when those barriers are resolved or minimized. Clinical pharmacogenomics also offers a new field for translational research and teaching at various levels.",

Conversely to genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are not permanent, thus represent opportunities for therapeutic strategies designed to reverse transcriptional abnormalities, and cancer is the first disease in which epigenetic therapies with chromatin remodeling agents were introduced. The role of miRNAs in gene regulation supports their potential as innovative therapeutic strategy. Recent evidences have proven that the environment can profoundly influence the epigenome: diet, smoking and alcohol consumption can negatively impact the expression profile. Given the plasticity of epigenetic marks, it is challenging the idea that the epigenetic alterations are 'druggable' sites using specific food components.",

In 2nd SYMPHONY, we compared low-dose sibrafiban plus aspirin (LDS+A), high-dose sibrafiban (HDS), and aspirin alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: When the first SYMPHONY results became known, enrollment in 2nd SYMPHONY was stopped prematurely at 6671 patients who had been treated for a median of 90 days. The primary end point of death, myocardial (re)infarction (MI), or severe recurrent ischemia did not differ significantly between aspirin (9.3%) and LDS+A (9.2%; OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.20) or HDS (10.5%; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.39) patients. Secondary end points did not differ significantly between aspirin and LDS+A patients. Death or MI occurred significantly more often with HDS (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.80), as did mortality alone (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.88) and MI (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.69). Major bleeding was significantly more frequent in LDS+A patients (5.7%) versus aspirin alone (4.0%) but not in HDS patients (4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aspirin with LDS did not improve outcomes after acute coronary syndromes and caused more bleeding compared with aspirin alone.

        "abstract": "Imaging studies have provided new insights on the role of dopamine (DA) in drug abuse and addiction in the human brain. These studies have shown that the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse in human beings are contingent not just on DA increases per se in the striatum (including the nucleus accumbens) but on the rate of DA increases. The faster the increases, the more intense the reinforcing effects. They have also shown that elevated levels of DA in the dorsal striatum are involved in the motivation to procure the drug when the addicted subject is exposed to stimuli associated with the drug (conditioned stimuli). In contrast, long-term drug use seems to be associated with decreased DA function, as evidenced by reductions in D2 DA receptors and DA release in the striatum in addicted subjects. Moreover, the reductions in D2 DA receptors in the striatum are associated with reduced activity of the orbitofrontal cortex (region involved with salience attribution and motivation and with compulsive behaviors) and of the cingulate gyrus (region involved with inhibitory control and impulsivity), which implicates deregulation of frontal regions by DA in the loss of control and compulsive drug intake that characterizes addiction. Because DA cells fire in response to salient stimuli and facilitate conditioned learning, their activation by drugs will be experienced as highly salient, driving the motivation to take the drug and further strengthening conditioned learning and producing automatic behaviors (compulsions and habits).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amblyopia is the commonest visual disorder of childhood in Western societies, affecting, predominantly, spatial visual function. Treatment typically requires a period of refractive correction ('optical treatment') followed by occlusion: covering the nonamblyopic eye with a fabric patch for varying daily durations. Recent studies have provided insight into the optimal amount of patching ('dose'), leading to the adoption of standardized dosing strategies, which, though an advance on previous ad-hoc regimens, take little account of individual patient characteristics. This trial compares the effectiveness of a standardized dosing strategy (that is, a fixed daily occlusion dose based on disease severity) with a personalized dosing strategy (derived from known treatment dose-response functions), in which an initially prescribed occlusion dose is modulated, in a systematic manner, dependent on treatment compliance.\\n\\nMETHODS/DESIGN: A total of 120 children aged between 3 and 8 years of age diagnosed with amblyopia in association with either anisometropia or strabismus, or both, will be randomized to receive either a standardized or a personalized occlusion dose regimen. To avoid confounding by the known benefits of refractive correction, participants will not be randomized until they have completed an optical treatment phase. The primary study objective is to determine whether, at trial endpoint, participants receiving a personalized dosing strategy require fewer hours of occlusion than those in receipt of a standardized dosing strategy. Secondary objectives are to quantify the relationship between observed changes in visual acuity (logMAR, logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution) with age, amblyopia type, and severity of amblyopic visual acuity deficit.\\n\\nDISCUSSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial of occlusion therapy for amblyopia to compare a treatment arm representative of current best practice with an arm representative of an entirely novel treatment regimen based on statistical modelling of previous trial outcome data. Should the personalized dosing strategy demonstrate superiority over the standardized dosing strategy, then its adoption into routine practice could bring practical benefits in reducing the duration of treatment needed to achieve an optimal outcome.\\n\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN12292232.",

        "abstract": "Aims: Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of SNPs associated with complex disease. The longitudinal significance of these variants is uncertain and clinical genomic studies are required to elucidate what clinical value these variants have. Linking DNA to clinical health information databases is a powerful and potentially low-cost means of performing such research. Here, we describe a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the potential of this method. Materials &amp; methods: A total of 376 individuals presenting to a hospital with severe coronary artery disease were enrolled into a prospective cohort study. DNA, demographic data, ethnicity and other clinical information was collected in an electronic database. Genotyping for SNPs rs2383207 and rs10757278 was performed using Sequenom\u00ae (CA, USA) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry. Health outcomes were tracked from when patients were discharged from the hospital using the New Zealand Health Information Service (Wellington, New Zealand). Results: A total of 253 (67%) patients were of New Zealand European descent, 47 (13%) patients were of Maori descent and 21 (6%) were of Pacific Island ancestry. The Maori and Pacific Island group were younger at presentation (63 \u00b1 11 vs 70 \u00b1 9 years of age; p &lt; 0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. The frequency of the at-risk rs2383207 G allele in the Maori and Pacific group was 70%, compared with 54% in Europeans (p = 0.002). Similarly, the rs10757278 G allele was also present at a higher frequency (68 vs 52%; p = 0.003). No association was seen between the rs10757278 SNP and cardiovascular risk factors or markers of disease severity. GA and GG individuals had a higher rate of cardiovascular (p = 0.04) and all-cause death (p = 0.02). Conclusion: The linking of genetic data to electronic medical databases is an effective tool to assess the longitudinal effect of gene variants on health outcomes and will aid in the implementation of personalized medicine.

A total of 35\\nveterans at the VA Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, USA were\\ninvited to enter their FHH information using the online SG-FHH tool,\\ncomplete the study's satisfaction survey and participate in a short\\nsemi-structured interview. The goal of the semi-structured interviews\\nwas to assess participants perceived facilitators and barriers to using\\nthe online SG-FHH tool. All participants were also provided with a\\nprinted copy of their pedigree, which was generated by the SG-FHH tool\\nand were encouraged to share it with their relatives and providers.\\nResults: The majority of participants (91%) said that they had access\\nto a computer with internet capability and 77% reported that they knew\\nhow to use a computer.

METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed database. Search parameters were \"personalized medicine\", \"individualized medicine\" and \"molecular medicine\". RESULTS: Personalized medicine based on molecular-genetic evaluation of functional proteins such as otoferlin, connexin 26 and KCNQ4 or the Usher gene is becoming increasingly important for the indication of CI in the context of infant deafness. Determination of HER2/EGFR mutations in the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene may be an important prognostic parameter for therapeutic decisions in head and neck cancer patients. In basal cell carcinoma therapy, mutations in the Hedgehog (PCTH1) and Smoothened (SMO) pathways strongly influence the indication of therapeutic Hedgehog inhibition, e.g. using small molecules. Analyses of c-Kit receptor, BRAF-600E and NRAS mutations are required for specific molecular therapy of metastasizing melanomas. The significant advances in the field of specific molecular therapy are best illustrated by the availability of the first gene therapeutic procedures for treatment of RPE65-induced infantile retinal degradation. CONCLUSION: The aim of personalized molecular medicine is to identify patients who will respond particularly positively or negatively (e.g. in terms of adverse side effects) to a therapy using the methods of molecular medicine. This should allow a specific therapy to be successfully applied or preclude its indication in order to avoid serious adverse side effects. This approach serves to stratify patients for adequate treatment.",

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer; if performance status is good, both elderly and younger patients can tolerate this treatment equally well. Customized cisplatin treatment, based on reduction of the nucleotide excision repair pathway function, could be an attractive approach, and the assessment of mitotic checkpoint genes can be used for selecting docetaxel treatment.

In this framework, systems pharmacology network-based approaches offer an appealing way for integrating multi-omics data and set the basis for defining systems-level drug response biomarkers. On the road to individualized tamoxifen treatment in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients, we examine the dynamics of the attendant pharmacological response mechanisms. By means of an \"integromics\" network approach, we assessed the tamoxifen effect through the way the high-order organization of interactome (i.e., the modules) is perturbed. To accomplish that, first we integrated the time series transcriptome data with the human protein interaction data, and second, an efficient module-detecting algorithm was applied onto the composite graphs. Our findings show that tamoxifen induces severe modular transformations on specific areas of the interactome. Our modular biomarkers in response to tamoxifen attest to the immunomodulatory role of tamoxifen, and further reveal that it deregulates cell cycle and apoptosis pathways, while coordinating the proteasome and basal transcription factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that informs the fields of personalized medicine and clinical pharmacology about the actual dynamic interactome response to tamoxifen administration.",

        "abstract": "A water treatment approach combining ultrafiltration (UF) and micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) techniques was used for the removal of organic contaminants in field produced water samples from Canada and the United States. Free oil droplets and suspended solids were separated by initial UF treatments while MEUF was necessary for the removal of dissolved organics. It was shown that the amphiphilic characteristics of some organics commonly existing in produced water contributed to lowering the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactant employed. Lower surfactant concentrations could, therefore, be employed leading to lower fouling and back contamination and higher permeate flux. In addition, the incorporation of organic contaminants into the structure of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) micelles resulted in larger size and higher dissolution capacity of the \"mixed micelles\". The performance of polymeric and ceramic membranes of different molecular weight cutoffs (MWCOs) was evaluated by analyzing the permeate flux, recovery ratio, and solute percent rejection as functions of trans-membrane pressure (TMP). A mathematical model based on Darcy's law and the resistance in-series model successfully described the flux decline as a function of TMP for the two field samples and the two membranes studied.",

        "abstract": "In many important settings, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to a stimulus or \"treatment.\" For instance, a treatment that works for the overall population might be highly ineffective, or even harmful, for a subgroup of subjects with specific characteristics. Similarly, a new treatment may not be better than an existing treatment in the overall population, but there is likely a subgroup of subjects who would benefit from it. The notion that \"one size may not fit all\" is becoming increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from economics to medicine. This has drawn significant attention to personalize the choice of treatment, so it is optimal for each individual. An optimal personalized treatment is the one that maximizes the probability of a desirable outcome. We call the task of learning the optimal personalized treatment personalized treatment learning. From the statistical learning perspective, this problem imposes important challenges, primarily because the optimal treatment is unknown on a given training set. A number of statistical methods have been proposed recently to tackle this problem. However, considering the critical importance of these methods to decision support systems, personalized treatment learning models have received relatively little attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method labeled causal conditional inference trees and its natural extension to causal conditional inference forests. The performance of the new method is analyzed and compared to alternative methods for personalized treatment learning. The results show that our new proposed method often outperforms the alternatives on the numerical settings described in this article. We also illustrate an application of the proposed method using data from a large Canadian insurer for the purpose of selecting the best targets for cross-selling an insurance product.",

        "abstract": "In a treatment-naive patient with chronic hepatitis B, a personalized approach allows treatment efficacy to be optimized. Firstly, the selection of good candidates for therapy is crucial. Patients with chronic active hepatitis B--with relatively low levels of HBV DNA replication (<10(9) copies/ml) and relatively high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels--are good candidates for therapy. By contrast, patients with chronic hepatitis B in the immunotolerance phase, who have high levels of HBV DNA and persistently normal ALT levels, as well as inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers with low HBV DNA and normal ALT levels do not have an indication for therapy as they are poor responders. Secondly, the characteristics of the patient (for example, gender, age, immune status, general health status and comorbidities), the characteristics of the liver disease (for example, presence of cirrhosis and liver function) and the characteristics of the virus (for example, genotype) are important when assessing the chance of success and when choosing the best therapeutic strategy (nucleoside/nucleotide analogue or interferon). Thirdly, during therapy, the antiviral effect--assessed by decrease in HBV DNA level--allows an individualized response-guided approach. In addition, quantification of HBsAg after 3-6 months of interferon therapy appears to be a good predictor of sustained virological response after treatment and HBsAg clearance. Continuing interferon therapy until week 48 is justified in patients with a significant decrease in HBsAg. Ongoing and future studies will provide useful information regarding prolonging interferon therapy beyond 48 weeks in some patients in order to increase efficacy, and also regarding the role of combination therapy with interferon and potent nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, such as entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.",

A total of 67 articles were identified. Polymorphic sites within the serotonin transporter gene promoter, 5-HTTLPR, were the most studied polymorphisms. All except three articles were designed as cohort studies. The other three articles included two meta-analyses and one decision-analytic model. The main finding from these meta-analyses was that the l variant was associated with a better response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The main conclusion from the decision-analytic model study was that performing genetic testing before prescribing antidepressant treatment may lead to greater numbers of patients experiencing remission early in treatment. Clinical outcomes of genotyping this polymorphism were evaluated by improvement of depression score, odds ratio and absolute risk reduction. \u00a9 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Numerous examples of the combinations of molecular characterization technologies aimed at better preclinical and clinical disease understanding, diagnosis and treatment are highlighted that are ideally situated to generate the intersectional innovation that drives healthcare advancement. The true value in patient-centric medicine will only be realized as the improved molecular characterization of disease provided by these technologies is integrated across platforms that operate directly in the patient and care provider space to provide a comprehensive view of health.

The enthusiasm expressed by researchers is well founded, but the expectations voiced by the public do not center on advancing technology. Rather, patients are asking for personalized care: a holistic approach that considers physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. This perspective considers psychological, religious, and ethical challenges that may arise as the precision of preventive medicine improves. Psychological studies already highlight the barriers to single gene testing and suggest significant barriers to the predictive testing envisioned by personalized medicine. Certain religious groups will likely mount opposition if they believe personalized medicine encourages embryo selection. If the technology prompts cost-containment discussions, those concerned about the sanctity of life may raise ethical objections. Consequently, the availability of new scientific developments does not guarantee advances in treatment because patients may prove unwilling to receive and act on personalized genetic information. This perspective highlights current efforts to incorporate personalized medicine and personalized care into the medical curriculum, genetic counseling, and other aspects of clinical practice. Because these efforts are generally independent, the authors offer recommendations for physicians and educators so that personalized medicine can be implemented in a manner that meets patient expectations for personalized care.",

A stronger and more scientific basis on which to build quality control and assurance of biomarker determination is needed.

The identification and validation of KRAS mutation status as a predictor of lack of benefit from cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer provides an important first step. However, KRAS mutation status does not appear to be predictive of cetuximab benefit in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, illustrating the necessity for separate biomarker validation to occur across tumor types. Numerous candidate biomarkers have been suggested based on noncontrolled exploratory analyses, but they require validation in sufficiently sized controlled studies. Key pending issues include distinguishing markers predictive of treatment benefit from those prognostic of disease outcome, selecting the best specimen for analysis (determining the tissue type and collection site, as well as the sample matrix type); and optimizing and standardizing assay technology and scoring systems, particularly for markers expressed over a continuous dynamic range. 2011 Future Medicine Ltd",

Many new cancer drugs target somatic alterations in tumors and are being developed with companion diagnostics. Oncology drug development and practice are likely to become increasingly stratified and utilize the enrichment Phase III trial paradigm. Although this paradigm includes an increasing number of successes, single-agent molecularly targeted treatment of metastatic disease will generally provide limited patient benefit. More substantial gains will require better understanding of crosstalk among signaling pathways, ability to combine drugs and use of drugs at initial diagnosis.

They may also influence treatment outcome for a variety of drugs - an emerging and important area of study. This research article leverages the International HapMap Consortium data to identify pathway components that differ in genotype frequency for four populations: individuals of Northern European descent from the USA (CEU), individuals from West Africa (YRI), Japan (JPT) and China (CHB). MATERIALS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; METHODS: By identifying loci with fixed or large frequency differences (\u03b4 = 1) between paired population samples (CEU vs YRI, CEU vs CHB, CEU vs JPT, YRI vs CHB, YRI vs JPT and CHB vs JPT), and reconstructing the physiological functions of genes at these loci, we report a list of pathways affected by natural selection during human evolution. RESULTS: Of the 3.7 million HapMap SNPs, 463 loci (which mapped to 38 genes) were fixed (\u03b4 = 1) in at least one population pair. These private loci included four nonsynonymous coding SNPs: rs4536103 (NEUROG3), rs1385699 (EDA2R), rs11946338 (ARHGAP24) and rs4422842 (CACNA1B). A total of four additional genes demonstrated evidence of recent positive selection: three genes in European subjects (IER5L, NPNT and SESTD1) and a single gene in Asian subjects (EXOC6B). DISCUSSION: Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggest that cellular differentiation, apoptosis and activation of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor vary between populations in genomic regions of fixed (private) SNPs identified in this study. Variability in these pathways may provide important clues into the mechanisms of human adaptation to different environments. An improved understanding of their variability may also help to explain race-specific differences in the treatment outcomes observed for a variety of modern drugs.",

We present the view that the acetylation status of individuals plays an important contributory role in the tuberculosis pandemic.

The correct maintenance dose of warfarin for a given patient is difficult to predict, the drug carries a high risk of toxicity, and variability among patients means that the safe dose range differs widely between individuals. Recent pharmacogenetic studies indicate that the routine incorporation of genetic testing into warfarin therapy protocols could substantially ease both the financial and health risks currently associated with this treatment. In particular, the variability in warfarin dose requirement is now recognized to be due, in large part, to polymorphisms in two genes: cytochrome P450 2C9 and the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1. The development of algorithms that integrate all of the relevant genetic and physical factors into comprehensive, individualized predictive models for warfar,in dose could be used to translate the results of pharmacogenetic testing into actionable clinical application.  2007 Future Medicine Ltd.",

There are significant interindividual variations in the degree of inflammation, disease course and the rate of joint progression in patients, with RA. A number of clinical, serological, environmental and genetic severity factors have been identified in patients with RA and can be used to help guide treatment. Therapeutic options for RA have significantly expanded in the last decade and now include both synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs as well as biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Owing to the variety of new drugs, their cost and incomplete information on side effects, markers of treatment response are needed. The study of treatment-specific genetic and protein biomarkers of response and toxicity in RA has produced exciting, yet inconsistent, results. Large scale genetic and proteome studies, which can now be performed at a relatively low cost, will likely broaden the scope and significance of biomarker studies in RA.

This etiological heterogeneity adds to the complexity when addressing variation in the response to antiasthma treatment. There is regular progress in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics in determining the efficacy and potential for adverse effects of the asthma medication from a patient's genetic background. This reveals that a clinically relevant variability in response to the asthma medications may be due to genetic determinants, and refers to the polymorphisms in the genes encoding either the drug targets, or the molecular component of the downstream signal transduction pathways responsible for drug actions. The major classes of asthma therapy, \u03b2-agonists, leukotriene antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids, demonstrate wide interindividual variability. The statistical issues, such as population stratification, sample size and statistical power, are crucial factors for the identification of significant biological marker(s) for patient's response. The aim of this review is to discuss the scientific rationale and outline the genetic impact on the variability in response to different asthma medications. In conclusion, despite of new developments and recent studies in asthma pharmacogenetics, significant gaps in knowledge still remain, and several replicate studies are needed in different populations to derive firm conclusions that may help to bring pharmacotyping into clinical practice. \u00a9 2006 Future Medicine Ltd.",

The patient's own data were not used in the models that yielded these predictions. Five pre-randomization variables that predicted differential response (marital status, employment status, life events, comorbid personality disorder, and prior medication trials) were included in regression models, permitting the calculation of each patient's Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), in HRSD units.\\n\\nRESULTS: For 60% of the sample a clinically meaningful advantage (PAI\u22653) was predicted for one of the treatments, relative to the other. When these patients were divided into those randomly assigned to their \"Optimal\" treatment versus those assigned to their \"Non-optimal\" treatment, outcomes in the former group were superior (d\u200a=\u200a0.58, 95% CI .17-1.01).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach to treatment selection, implemented in the context of two equally effective treatments, yielded effects that, if obtained prospectively, would rival those routinely observed in comparisons of active versus control treatments.",

Here, we extend the approach to patients with other advanced cancers. Tumors resected from 14 patients with refractory advanced cancers were propagated in immunodeficient mice and treated with 63 drugs in 232 treatment regimens. An effective treatment regimen in the xenograft model was identified for 12 patients. One patient died before receiving treatment, and the remaining 11 patients received 17 prospectively guided treatments. Fifteen of these treatments resulted in durable partial remissions. In 2 subjects, no effective treatments were found. Overall, there was a remarkable correlation between drug activity in the model and clinical outcome, both in terms of resistance and sensitivity. The data support the use of the personalized tumorgraft model as a powerful investigational platform for therapeutic decision making and to efficiently guide cancer treatment in the clinic.",

The paradigm established by cytogenetic studies in leukemia (from gene discovery to therapeutic intervention) now has the potential to be rapidly extended with the use of whole-genome sequencing approaches for cancer, which are now possible. We are now entering a period of exponential growth in cancer gene discovery that will provide many novel therapeutic targets for a large number of cancer types. Establishing the pathogenetic relevance of individual mutations is a major challenge that must be solved. However, after thousands of cancer genomes have been sequenced, the genetic rules of cancer will become known and new approaches for diagnosis, risk stratification and individualized treatment of cancer patients will surely follow.",

Methods: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsychINFO and Cochrane CENTRAL was conducted from the earliest possible date through to 1 July 2012. The search was performed using the following medical subject headings: bipolar disorder, lithium, lithium carbonate, pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics, polymorphism and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Five of 71 identified studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were abstracted using a standardized data abstraction tool. For categorical end points, the pooled odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated. Random effects models were used for analysis. Results: The Val66Met polymorphism did not predict response to prophylactic lithium in this combined population (odds ratio: 2.67; p = 0.078). Conclusion: This analysis suggests that the Val66Met polymorphism does not predict response to lithium treatment in bipolar disorder in this combined population.

Technological limitations for sequencing a patient\u2019s DNA fast and affordably are rapidly disappearing. At the same time, more and more is known about the role of DNA variation in disease susceptibility, disease development and response to treatment. Consequently, more and more pediatricians, cardiologists and other medical specialists would like to apply NGS-based diagnostics. The standard, comprehensive and easy-to-handle genetic test these specialists are looking for, however, is not yet available. Molecular diagnostic laboratories have started to implement NGS into their routine workflows, but are also becoming increasingly aware that the context in which they operate is changing. It becomes apparent that the major challenges are not in the technology, but rather in anticipating the changing scope and scale. Developing the infrastructure to sustainably perform NGS-based diagnostics in a changing technological, clinical and societal context is therefore more relevant than defining minimal performance criteria or standard analysis pipelines. Implementing NGS-based diagnostics comes with novel applications, emerging service models and reconfiguration of professional roles, and should thus be considered in the context of future healthcare.

Method: We conducted a case\u2013control study using 73 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with depression and referred to a tertiary center, The Institute of Living (Hartford, CT, USA), for treatment resistance or intolerable side-effects to psychotropic drugs. The controls were 120 cardiovascular patients from Hartford Hospital being treated for dyslipidemia but otherwise healthy and not psychiatrically ill. DNA typing to detect polymorphisms in the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 was accomplished with the Tag-It\u2122 mutation detection assay and the Luminex xMAP\u00ae system. Results: The percentage of individuals in psychiatric versus control groups with two wild-type alleles for CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genes, were 50 versus 74% (p < 0.001), 71 versus 73% (not statistically signifi cant) and 36 versus 43% (trend, p < 0.2), respectively. Within the psychiatric population, 57% of individuals were carriers of non-wild-type alleles for 2\u20133 genes, compared with 36% in the control population (p < 0.0001). The balance, 43% in the psychiatric population and 64% in the control, were carriers of non-wild-type alleles for none or one gene. Conclusions: These fi ndings reveal that clinically relevant CYP2C9 polymorphisms occur more frequently in depressed psychiatric patients than in nonpsychiatric controls. The same trend was found for polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene. We found a signifi cant cumulative metabolic defi ciency in the psychiatric population for combinations of the CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genes. The signifi cant enrichment of CYP2C9-defi cient alleles in the psychiatric population validates a previously reported association of this gene with the risk for depression disorders. The high prevalence of carriers with defi cient and null alleles suggests that CYP450 DNA typing may play a role in the management of psychiatric patients at tertiary care institutions. KEYWORDS:",

A 6-year-old boy diagnosed with ADHD was prescribed methylphenidate 5 mg twice daily (7 am and noon) and the family was compliant with administration of this medication. On the first day of treatment, the patient had an adverse reaction, becoming disobedient, more mischievous, erratic, resistant to discipline, would not go to sleep until midnight, and had a poor appetite. The All-In-One PGX (All-In-One Pharmacogenetics for Antipsychotics test for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9) was performed using microarray-based and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. The genotype of our patient was identified to be CYP2D6*2/*10, with isoforms of the enzyme consistent with a predicted cytochrome P450 2D6 intermediate metabolizer phenotype. Consequently, the physician adjusted the methylphenidate dose to 2.5 mg once daily in the morning. At this dosage, the patient had a good response without any further adverse reactions. Pharmacogenetic testing should be included in the management plan for ADHD. In this case, cooperation between the medical team and the patients' relatives was key to successful treatment.Keywords: attention deficit hyperactive disorder, pharmacogenomics, CYP2D6, adverse drug reactions, dose adjustment, intermediate metabolizer",

In the present study, we present an imaging-based, personalized interventional approach to the therapy of tricuspid regurgitation.\\n\\nMETHODS: In our porcine model, we used rapid prototyping to build a matrix reproducing the geometry of the right atrium that was previously derived from computer tomography (CT) scans. Over this matrix, a braided nitinol device fitting almost completely the right atrium was crafted. An additional tubular stent component was developed to carry a tissue valve prosthesis. This part was designed to be connectable to the annular portion of the main device. In our feasibility study, the crimped device was implanted via jugular access into the right atrium of 12 pigs and expanded subsequently. Following isolated implantation of the device without the valve-carrying component, further procedures included implantation of the whole composite device, including the mentioned tissue valve. Representing a only feasibility study, all implantations were performed under full bypass and direct sight. On-site visualization was performed by both echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Additional imaging was realized by postoperative CT scans.\\n\\nRESULTS: Following implantation, 9 of 12 animals were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Correct positioning of the device and orthodromic blood flow as maintained by the valve prosthesis were demonstrated by echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Postoperative contrast CT evaluation demonstrated proper fitting of the device into the right-sided heart cavities without obstruction of the outflow tract. Autopsy additionally confirmed its correct positioning without major trauma to surrounding structures.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility in principle of a personalized interventional treatment for tricuspid regurgitation using a braided stent, based on individual cardiac imaging, with anchoring forces mainly exerted on the venae cavae and on the inner surface of the right atrium. The design process of this device is a good indicator of the growing potential of an imaging-based personalized simulation and production approach for the treatment of tricuspid valve disease.",

The rate of progress has been driven not only by the determination and ongoing decipherment of the human genome sequence but also by the advent of new technological developments that have dramatically reduced the costs of genetic analysis. As a consequence, a considerable number of genetic testing centers have emerged, both in Europe and the USA, which together offer a plethora of different genetic tests. Methods: We have performed a nationwide survey of 18 private genetic testing laboratories in Greece in order to acquire a better understanding of the genetic testing services that these centers provide, specifically the types of genetic test offered, the target groups, marketing channels, costs of analysis and accreditation. Results: Molecular genetic and cytogenetic testing were found to be the predominant types of genetic testing services offered although there is an increasing demand for pharmacogenomic testing. The main target group for private genetic testing laboratories is the physicians who are approached via the internet, through personal contacts from sales representatives and at scientific conferences. Genetic testing costs are fairly low in Greece. Although the majority of private genetic laboratories either employ or collaborate with a genetic counselor, few of them are accredited for the provision of genetic testing services. Conclusion: This study constitutes the basis for a critical appraisal of the private genetic testing environment in Greece and provides a model for replication in other European countries. 2011 Future Medicine Ltd",

Although there have been enormous advances in the genetic underpinnings of obesity in recent years, the pathways that lead to obesity are still not completely understood. one of the ongoing challenges is the lack of a comprehensive definition of the obese phenotype that encompasses intermediary phenotypic expressions of biological and behavioral nature. Interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including nutrient exposures and dietary behaviors, can influence the development of the obese phenotype. Specifically, genes play a decisive role in the etiology of childhood obesity under the permissive circumstances of an obesogenic environment (increase in energy intake with a decrease in physical activity). Like many diseases, the causes of obesity are complex and their investigation requires novel approaches. Given the many contributors to obesity (weight gain, weight loss, weight maintenance, variability in body composition), as well as the dynamic nature of this issue, genomic tools must continue to be employed to evaluate all dimensions of the obesity phenotype, such as biochemical characteristics, susceptibility markers, nutrient intake, feeding practices and gene-environment interactions. Fundamental knowledge of the types of genes involved and available gene-diet interaction studies in children's obesity are reviewed. Although there is a paucity of existing literature in this specific domain of childhood obesity, ongoing investigations utilizing large cohorts have potential for providing the knowledge needed for targeted interventions in the future.",

The population pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic model was created using a nonlinear mixed-effect approach (NONMEM\u00ae v.7.2.0., ICON Development Solutions, Dublin, Ireland). Results: Covariates significantly related to LPV/r apparent clearance (CL/F) were ritonavir trough concentration (RTC), BMI, high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding for metabolizing enzymes, which are representable as follows: CL/F = (0.216BMI + 0.0125HDL-C) \u00d7 0.713RTC 0.302CYP3A4[1461insA/del] \u00d7 1.26rs28371764[C/T] \u00d7 0.528rs6945984[C/C] \u00d7 Conclusion: The LPV/r standard dose appears to be appropriate for the rs28371764[C/T] genotype.

This paper reviews a robust literature on public attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing. In general, attitudes are positive about genetic research and new genomic technologies, with majorities indicating an interest in genetic testing. However, complex beliefs comprise the public's thinking about genetics. Attitudes are driven by beliefs about the type of genetic research, the personal and clinical utility of tests, and the area of genetics in which testing is applied. Limitations of current research are noted and suggestions made for future research.",

Even with conscientious International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring, warfarin initiation carries a high risk of hemorrhage. Pharmacogenetic studies have determined that variants in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes help to predict the therapeutic warfarin dose. Whether using this information prospectively will,prevent under- and over-dosing of warfarin is unknown. To answer this question, the CoumaGen investigators randomized half of a 200-patient cohort beginning warfarin therapy to clinical dosing and half to pharmacogenetic dosing. Overall, pharmacogenetic dosing slightly increased time in the therapeutic INR range (p = not significant) and decreased the number of INR tests required. The trial has important implications for the new NIH-funded multicentered trial. Here, we discuss the Couma-Gen study and its implications for the design, randomization, blinding and end point definition of future studies. 2008 Future Medicine Ltd",

Methods: By semi-automatic screening of over 150,000 trials, we filtered trials with stratified biomarker to analyze their therapeutic focus, major drivers and elucidated the impact of stratified biomarker programs on trial duration and completion. Results: >5% of trials are using molecular biomarker for stratification; duration of such trials is longer. 21% of them are done in late stages and Oncology is the major focus. Conclusion: Trials with stratified biomarker in drug development has quadrupled in last decade but represents a small part of all interventional trials reflecting multiple co-developmental challenges of therapeutic compounds and companion diagnostics.",

MATERIALS & METHODS: A web-based survey of PCPs who are members of Knowledge Networks' Physician Consulting Network was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 502 respondents (23.3% response rate), most ordered genetic tests infrequently. When presented with the direct-to-consumer genomic testing reports, most believed the reports were understandable, and would be willing to review results with a patient, and many believed the results would be helpful in patient management. CONCLUSION: Despite limited experience with genetic tests, PCPs are open to helping patients understand genomic information. However, additional physician education is needed.",

In a Russian urban population, 85% of 2000 respondents answered positively to a question about their own willingness to undergo predictive genetic testing for preventable health conditions. Gender, age and health status significantly influenced response. Multivariate discriminant analyses revealed that wanting to know about probable future diseases, readiness to improve lifestyles and an interest in learning about individual genome characteristics are the most important predictors for wanting to be tested. Along with the high level of interest, highly overestimated expectations were encountered in many studies. With the low predictive abilities of currently available genetic tests for common disorders, proper interpretation of the data and genetic counseling are essential. There is a need for prospective validation of genetic panels for risk assessments, and for efforts to measure the effects of genetic information disclosure and how this information might contribute to lifestyle changes.",

There has been an increased effort to identify polymorphisms within the gene and determine their clinical consequences. However, most of these efforts have focused on populations of European descent. Herein we report the influence of CYP2C9 genotype on warfarin dose among European American and African American patients. We also identify two new mutations; one in the coding region and one in the non-coding region of the CYP2C9 gene. METHODS: Patients (\u226520 years of age) are enrolled after obtaining medical, lifestyle and concomitant medication history. Changes in International Normalized Ratio (INR), warfarin dose, co-medications, diet, physical activity and the occurrence of complications are documented. CYP2C9 genotype was determined using PCR-RFLP and pyrosequencing. Differences in genotype frequencies and HWE assumptions were assessed using \u03c7(2) statistics and exact tests. The genotype dose association was evaluated using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: This report includes 490 patients (mean age 60.6 \u00b1 15.6, 51.3% men). African American patients comprise 48.9% of the cohort with mean follow-up of 13.5 (\u00b110.6) months. Both the CYP2C9 *2 and *3 allele were more frequent in European Americans (11.24%, 5.1%) compared to African Americans (1.1% and 1.8%). CYP2C9 *5 (0.9%), *6 (0.4%), and *11 (1.1%) variants were only observed in African Americans. The variant genotype is more frequent among European Americans compared to African Americans (29.8% vs. 9.73%, p<0.0001). Warfarin dose was significantly related to CYP2C9 genotype (p<0.0001) both in univariate and multivariate analyses. Multivariable race-specific analyses highlight the contribution of CYP2C9 genotype among European American but not among African American patients. CONCLUSION: The variant CYP2C9 genotype is more frequent among European Americans compared to African Americans. Among African Americans the variant genotype frequency is higher than previously reported. CYP2C9 genotype predicts warfarin dose in European Americans, but not in African Americans.",

We then examine the armamentarium of policy actions beyond higher reimbursement that may be employed to enhance the economic incentives for developing stratified medicines. In the absence of significant pricing and total oncology outlay flexibility by payers, our analysis suggests that private sector investment in small oncology segments, and in stratified medicine generally, may not prove economically sustainable, thus endangering the translation of scientific advances into bedside medicines. Beyond increasing reimbursement, decreasing development cycle time and costs, or both, would most directly improve the economic incentives facing developers. By contrast, extending exc...",

Two inherited SNPs termed CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and *3(Ile359Leu) are known to affect catalytic function. Numerous rare or functionally silent polymorphism have been identified. About 35% of the Caucasian population carries at least one *2 or *3 allele. CYP2C9 metabolizes several oral hypoglycemics, oral anticoagulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other drugs, including phenytoin, losarta, fluvastatin, and torsemide. In vitro studies with several drugs indicate that the Cys144(.2) and Leu359(.3) variants confer obly about 70 and 10% of the intrinsic clearance of the wild-type protein (.1), respectively. The clinical pharmacokinetic implications of these polymorphisms vary depending on the enzymes contribution to total oral clearance. Several studies demonstrated that the CYP2C9 polymorphisms are medically important for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for oral hypoglycemics. vitamin K antagonistics oral anticoagulants, and phenytoin. In particular, CYP2C9 polymorphisms should be routinely considered in therapy with oral anticoagulants where severe adverse events at initiation of therapy might be reduced by genotyping. CYP2C9 polymorphisms were also clinically associated with side effects of phenytoin, with gastric bleeding during therapy with non-steroidals and with hypoglycemia under oral hypoglycemic drugs. Data appear mature enough for the routine consideration of CYP2C9 genotyps in therapy with acenocoumarol, phenytoin, warfarin, and some other drugs. Nevertheless, it is advisable before the routine clinical use of these genotype data to rigourously test the benefits of genotype-based therapeutic recommendations by randomized controlled clinical trials.",

Recent advances in science have taken this one step further with the technology now available to use both a candidate and whole-genome approach to explore the genetics of host-virus interactions, as well as the pharmacogenetics of the toxicity and efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. The genetics of host-virus interactions have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV which will aid in the research and development of an HIV vaccine. Most published HIV pharmacogenetic studies have utilized a candidate gene approach. Although these types of studies have provided insight into the pathogenesis and pharmacogenetics of drug disposition, drug interactions, drug efficacy and toxicity and host-virus interactions, very few will lend themselves to a widespread clinical application. The application of HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity acts as an important example of the successful widespread implementation of a pharmacogenetic test into the clinic and defines the key steps necessary for the clinical application of pharmacogenetic tests in general.

However, this development has occurred in a time of intense public ambivalence to life science and genomics innovations. Controversies revolve around genetic modification, stem cell technologies and human genetic databases. Debate about databases focuses on how to balance the benefits from genetic research against civic concerns, typically, privacy and unfair discrimination and, more recently, public trust. In 1989, Australian jurisdictions began developing regulatory standards for human genetic databases but from the start these lacked uniformity and adequate scope. Enduring concerns led to a widescale public inquiry (2001-2003), which produced the Essentially Yours report. However, while the Australian government supports many of the report's recommendations, civic concerns remain as policy responses are checkered. In this special report, we reflect on the debate, the rise of the inquiry, its recommendations and policy responses, and competency and trust in regulation. \u00a9 2007 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Here, we extend the approach to patients with other advanced cancers. Tumors resected from 14 patients with refractory advanced cancers were propagated in immunodeficient mice and treated with 63 drugs in 232 treatment regimens. An effective treatment regimen in the xenograft model was identified for 12 patients. One patient died before receiving treatment, and the remaining 11 patients received 17 prospectively guided treatments. Fifteen of these treatments resulted in durable partial remissions. In 2 subjects, no effective treatments were found. Overall, there was a remarkable correlation between drug activity in the model and clinical outcome, both in terms of resistance and sensitivity. The data support the use of the personalized tumorgraft model as a powerful investigational platform for therapeutic decision making and to efficiently guide cancer treatment in the clinic.

Influenza vaccines have significant immune response variability across the population. Most of the current circulating strains of influenza A virus are resistant to anti-influenza drugs. It is necessary to understand how genetic variants affect immune responses, especially responses to the HA and NA transmembrane glycoproteins. The elucidation of the underlying mechanisms can help identify patient subgroups for effective prevention and treatment. New personalized vaccines, adjuvants, and drugs may result from the understanding of interactions of host genetic, environmental, and other factors. The systems biology approach is to simulate and model large networks of the interacting components, which can be excellent targets for antiviral therapies. The elucidation of host-influenza interactions may provide an integrative view of virus infection and host responses. Understanding the host-influenza-drug interactions may contribute to optimal drug combination therapies. Insight of the host-influenza-vaccine interactions, especially the immunogenetics of vaccine response, may lead to the development of better vaccines. Systemic studies of host-virus-vaccine-drug-environment interactions will enable predictive models for therapeutic responses and the development of individualized therapeutic strategies.

Given its variability among patients and indirect evidence of its heritability, anti psychotic-induced weight gain has become a major target of pharmacogenetic studies. The protective effect of the T allele of the 5-HT2C receptor gene -759C/T promoter polymorphism on antipsychotic-induced weight gain has been repeatedly reported in independent studies. However, negative results have also been obtained, especially in subjects treated with clozapine. Recently, de Luca and colleagues investigated the association between the 5-HT2C receptor gene -759C/T promoter polymorphism and antipsychotic-induced weight gain using a meta-analytical approach {[}1]. The pooled data of eight studies (total 588 subjects) showed a trend of association between the -759T allele and lower weight gain, with evidence of significant between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias and the influence of confounding variables, such as age, gender, ethnicity, clozapine-treated patient proportions, durations of observation and the effect of weight gain cutoff criteria on effect size, were also evaluated in their meta-analysis. To clarify the contribution of the 5-HT2C receptor gene to a complex trait such as anti psychotic-induced weight gain, a greater number of independent studies with larger sample size that carefully consider various confounding factors and gene-environment interactions are required.",

The CYP2C9*2 (430C>T), CYP2C9*3 (1075A>C) and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms affect warfarin dose through altered metabolism (CYP2C9) and sensitivity (VKORC1). Objective: We determined the frequencies of SNPs in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes in a clinical outpatient population and the carrier prevalences for a variety of genotype combinations to gauge the impact of these polymorphisms on warfarin dosage using published algorithms. Method: A total of 127 patients from an outpatient clinic at Hartford Hospital (Hartford, CT, USA) were genotyped for five SNPs in the CYP2C9 gene and seven SNPs in the VKORC1 gene using Luminex technology. Results: The polymorphism frequencies were 10.2, 7.9 and 37.4% for the functionally deficient CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms, respectively. Combining prevalence of combinatorial genotypes, 18% were carriers of both CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms, 13% were CYP2C9 polymorphism carriers only, 42.5% were VKORC1 carriers only, and the remaining 27% were noncarriers for either gene, Based on published warfarin dosing algorithms, carriers of 1, 2, 3 and 4 functionally deficient polymorphisms predict reductions of 1.0 to 1.6, 2.0 to 2.9, 2.9 to 3.7, and 3.6 to 4.4 mg/day, respectively, in warfarin dose. Conclusion: Overall, 73% of the population carried at least one polymorphism predicting deficient warfarin metabolism or responsiveness and 18% were carriers for polymorphisms in both genes studied.

Although Greek genetic testing laboratories offer a variety of different genetic tests, relatively little is known about how either the general public or medical practitioners perceive genetic testing services. Materials & methods: We have therefore performed a nationwide survey of the views of 1717 members of the general public, divided into three age groups, from all over Greece, and residing in both large and small cities and villages, in order to acquire a better understanding of how they perceive genetic testing. We also canvassed the opinions of 496 medical practitioners with regard to genetic testing services in a separate survey that addressed similar issues. Results: Our subsequent analysis indicated that a large proportion of the general public is aware of the nature of DNA, genetic disorders and the potential benefits of genetic testing, although this proportion declines steadily with age. Furthermore, a large proportion of the interviewed individuals would be willing to undergo genetic testing even if the cost of analysis was not covered by healthcare insurance. However, a relatively small proportion of the general public has actually been advized to undergo genetic testing, either by relatives or physicians. Most physicians believe that the regulatory and legal framework that governs genetic testing services in Greece is rather weak. Interestingly, the vast majority of the general public strongly opposes direct-access genetic testing, and most would prefer referral from a physician than from a pharmacist. Conclusion: Overall, our results provide a critical evaluation of the views of the general public with regard to genetics and genetic testing services in Greece and should serve as a model for replication in other populations. \u00a9 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",

(CO, USA). Opinions range from prohibition to free-for-all and all the shades in between. However, there has been very little progress in formulating regulations and the situation in Europe is particularly confusing, making it difficult for the provider and the consumer alike. The regulations maze is likely to be one major reason why the growth and public uptake has been slow: it is hard for companies to know how to operate and equally hard for consumers to understand what tests are useful versus those of dubious quality. This article gives a brief overview of the current situation regarding what regulations exist and looks closely at the areas where more clarity is needed. These include, exactly what should be regulated? What is health-related data? Who can and who should be able to have access to personal genetics? We conclude with specific proposals for improving the protection for consumers and encouraging growth of useful services.",

It is hypothesized that women have variable hemostatic responses to anticoagulant drugs. Materials & methods: The hemostatic responses in healthy males (n = 10) and females (n = 10) were evaluated by performing various assays in the presence of anticoagulant drugs. Citrated whole blood from healthy volunteers (n = 20) was supplemented with rivaroxaban (final concentration [FC] = 0.3 (mu)g/ml) and enoxaparin (FC =5 (mu)g/ml). Results: Differences between males and females were noted in the whole blood activated partial thromboplastin time (p = 0.0442) and Heptest(registered trademark) (p = 0.0345) assays in the saline control values. In the plasma system, rivaroxaban at a FC of 0.3 g/ml and enoxaparin at 5 g/ml showed a gender-based difference in the Heptest (p = 0.0423). Females showed faster fibrin formation than males. In the plasma system, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and domain-dimer assays (American Diagnostica, CT, USA) were performed with domain-dimer showing differences (p = 0.035). In the von Willebrand factor multimers, only band 5 showed differences (p = 0.032). Gender-based differences were observed. Conclusion: Careful adjustment of the dosages of anticoagulant drugs may be necessary to avoid bleeding or thrombosis. (copyright) 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.",

By analogy to genome-wide scanning, the construction of a clinical phenome scan includes a complete scan of all clinically available information (housed in electronic medical records). This is done on a subject-by-subject basis and the resulting phenomes can subsequently be interrogated for association with a single allele for any given gene.

While many reasons for the lack of duplication of this model may exist, the need for accelerated innovation in drug development paired with the opportunity of integrating biomarker-driven research into drug development programs may lead to new and creative ways of fostering the cooperation between drug developers and test manufacturers. The rapid increase in knowledge about biomarkers and our understanding of disease and disease mechanisms open unprecedented prospects to make not only better, more informed decisions regarding patient care, but also strategic decisions during drug development. This requires that a biomarker strategy becomes an integral part of (early) drug development and that new, innovative paths are tried towards a model that combines the scientific approach with an economically feasible implementation strategy. Collaborative research, the use of new communication tools, the exploration of alternative ways to position a product in the market, and other considerations are part of such a strategy.

        "abstract": "The current use of analgesics is based on the empiric administration of a given drug with clinical monitoring for efficacy and toxicity. However, individual responses to drugs are influenced by a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, and each of these components, in addition to pain perception and processing, seem to be regulated by genetic factors. Whereas polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, polymorphic drug targets and disease-related pathways may influence the pharmacodynamic action of drugs. After usual dose, drug toxicity, as well as inefficacy, can be observed depending on the polymorphism, the analgesic considered and the presence or absence of active metabolites. Thus, cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 polymorphism influences codeine and tramadol analgesic effects, CYP2C9 has an impact on the disposition of some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioid receptor polymorphism (118A>G) may reduce morphine potency. Moreover, drug interaction mimics genetic deficiency and contributes to the variability in response to analgesics. This two-part review summarizes the available data on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic consequences of known polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase), drug transporters (multidrug resistance proteins, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, organic anion-transporting polypeptides, and serotonin transporters), relevant drug targets (such as mu-opioid receptor, serotonin receptor and cyclooxygenases) and other nonopioid biological systems, on currently prescribed central and peripheral analgesics.",

A recent longitudinal cohort study of individuals who underwent consumer genome scanning found minimal impacts of testing on risk-reducing lifestyle behaviors, such as diet and exercise. These results raise an important question: is personal genomic information likely to beneficially impact public health through motivation of lifestyle behavioral change? In this article, we review the literature on lifestyle behavioral change in response to genetic testing for common disease susceptibility variants. We find that only a few studies have been carried out, and that those that have been done have yielded little evidence to suggest that the mere provision of genetic information alone results in widespread changes in lifestyle health behaviors. We suggest that further study of this issue is needed, in particular studies that examine response to multiplex testing for multiple genetic markers and conditions. This will be critical as we anticipate the wide availability of whole-genome sequencing and more comprehensive phenotyping of individuals. We also note that while simple communication of genomic information and disease susceptibility may be sufficient to catalyze lifestyle changes in some highly motivated groups of individuals, for others, additional strategies may be required to prompt changes, including more sophisticated means of risk communication (e.g., in the context of social norm feedback) either alone or in combination with other promising interventions (e.g., real-time wireless health monitoring devices).",

The purpose of this study was to assess attitudes towards pharmacogenetic testing not previously highlighted within a larger study on clinicians' knowledge and attitudes about pharmacogenetic testing conducted by an interdisciplinary group of researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Materials & methods: The sample included 184 responses to an open-ended question. A thematic analysis of these responses was completed. Results: The thematic analysis identified several themes that were not previously delineated within the original study. The analysis uncovered five additional themes including: application concerns, lack of successful integration, accessibility, potential harm and optimism. Conclusion: Future research on the assessment of attitudes of clinicians concerning pharmacogenomics should incorporate these themes.

Six economic evaluations of testing were identified, which all recommended that TPMT testing is a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Critical appraisal, using published guidelines, showed potential limitations in model structures, approaches to data analysis and input parameters, which were mainly-based on expert opinion. Where data did exist these were from retrospective studies. To conduct economic evaluations with more robust findings, decision analysts need good quality data for the following key parameters: current prevalence of profound neutropenia among patients prescribed thiopurine drugs; mean length of related hospitalization and clinical outcome; impact of introducing the test on clinical pathways in terms of resource use; and clinical effectiveness data in terms of number of cases of neutropenia averted and subsequent impact on mortality and health-related quality of life. An iterative approach may be used to stimulate the production of a sufficient evidence base for innovative technologies such as pharmacogenetic testing. Such an iterative approach involves starting with simple models using available existing clinical and resource use data, as in the case of TPMT testing. The use of formal value of information methods may guide the decision whether prospective studies are required to address uncertainties in the key parameters driving the model results. The results from well-designed prospective studies can then be used to populate more complex economic models. 2009 Future Medicine Ltd",

However, approximately 25% of IBD patients experience toxicity, and up to 10% show resistance to these thiopurine drugs. The importance of genetic variability in determining thiopurine toxicity was first recognized over 25 years ago with the discovery of the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphism and the occurrence of azathioprine-induced myelosuppression in TPMT-deficient patients. In the intervening period, TPMT has become the foremost example of pharmacogenetics, and TPMT deficiency represents one of the few pharmacogenetic phenomena that have successfully made the transition from the research laboratory to diagnostics. While TPMT activity predicts some cases of myelosuppression, deficiency in this enzyme is neither predictive of other adverse drug reactions, nor resistance to thiopurine therapy. As myelosuppression only accounts for approximately 2.5% of adverse reactions in IBD patients, researchers are increasingly turning their attention to other enzymes involved in thiopurine metabolism to find molecular explanations for intolerance and resistance to azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge with regards to TPMT and also explore genetic variability, beyond TPMT that may contribute to thiopurine response in IBD patients. \u00a9 2008 Future Medicine Ltd.",

        "abstract": "After 50 years of wandering among new discovery technologies and a\\nworrying antiquated development process, the research and development\\n(R&D) enterprise may finally have found a way out of its wilderness\\nthrough the auspices of translational medicine. For that to happen, a\\nnumber of problems have to be confronted. Most prominent is the\\ntraditional problem credited with giving rise to translational medicine\\n- the lack of a feedback loop from bench to bedside. However, there are\\nequally significant roadblocks to be confronted at every turn along the\\nR&D pathway, from basic research through discovery and preclinical\\ntesting and, finally, into the clinic. Translational medicine is now\\nbeginning to encompass other powerful and promising innovations such as\\npersonalized medicine, bioinformatics, advanced imaging and biomarkers\\nto help move beyond these roadblocks. Although translational medicine\\nhas attracted significant financial support in recent years, the\\neconomics of the movement are still challenging, as public and private\\nsector funding are both difficult to come by due to the economic\\ndownturn. Some of the dearth of monies has been redressed by foundations\\nand public-private partnerships, which combine resources and, hence,\\ndivide the risk to the benefit of all. More recently, the inherent\\ntension among the traditional roles of `big pharma', biotechs and the\\npublic sector, which had waned somewhat in the wake of the Bayh-Dole\\nlegislation in the USA, has re-emerged owing to the furor over conflicts\\nof interest. Translational medicine may help alleviate these tensions by\\nits example of successful precompetitive collaboration, such as the\\nPredictive Safety Testing Consortium and its effective use of project\\nmanagement techniques in multidisciplinary, multiphasic, multisectoral\\nprojects to bring the discipline necessary for the efficient functioning\\nof consortia. Changing a research paradigm that has remained\\nsubstantially unchanged for half a century will require considerable\\ntime, money and effort. However, there is reason to be optimistic that\\ntranslational medicine is the right solution for the right problem at\\nthe right time.",

Methods: A cross-sectional survey instrument was sent via postal mail to pharmacists (n = 319) who were randomly selected from the New York State database of licensed pharmacists. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed. Results: The response rate was 32% (n = 102). The majority (83%) of respondents had been exposed to basic concepts in genetics, while PGx was not an integral part of their education. Most respondents indicated being somewhat confident in their knowledge of PGx-related concepts. In addition, 64% of respondents reported being interested in attending 1-10 h of continuing education programs in PGx, and 42% of respondents indicated being interested in obtaining a certificate in PGx. Conclusion: Educational program development in the format of continuing education or certificate is needed to improve pharmacists' education, confidence and training needs in PGx.

This article takes this as a good reason to explore biomarkers in depth and to speculate about the consequences that biomarkers might engender in clinical practices. First, the article ventures into an endeavor of ordering the dynamic field of biomarkers, suggesting a possible classification of biomarkers, and then argues that we are currently witnessing a \u2018biomarkerization\u2019 of health and disease \u2013 defined as an ongoing future-oriented process that seeks to solve biomedical as well as public health problems through investments into biomarker research at the present time. Subsequently, this article reflects on some possible consequences of this phenomenon. It argues that while the movement of candidate biomarkers into the clinic is arduous, biomarkers might develop a life of their own once they arrive in the clinic. This article outlines the direction of two such possible consequences. It suggests that biomarkers might be involved in a change of the actors that order and categorize diseases, as well as trigger transformations in our understanding of what counts as disease in the first place. Hence, this article seeks to shed light on the paradox that while biomarkers are designed to add more evidence into clinical practice, they might actually increase uncertainty and ambiguity.",

Results: Our data revealed that only 11.5% of respondents from the general public had been advised to take a genetic test in order to explore the relationship between their genes and their nutritional status. Although 80.5% of healthcare professionals would have been willing to recommend their patients/clients to undergo nutrigenomic analysis to correlate their genetic profile with their diet, only 17.2% of respondents had actually done so.

Therefore, as with mRNAs, researchers have focused on the global analyses of miRNAs to seek their potential use as biomarkers for physiological and pathological states of a cell. Methods developed for miRNA profiling are briefly discussed in this review. Recent evidences supporting the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in both differentiation and cancer are presented.

Genetic testing and molecular diagnostic usage was categorized by major testing groups: infectious disease, cancer and inherited/other acquired conditions. Results: Per-person testing cost grew by 14% per year between 2008 and 2011, primarily resulting from increased utilization. Spending per person for Medicare and Medicaid was higher than for commercially insured patients. Expenditure across the USA was estimated at US$5.5 billion in 2011, up 13% from 2010. Discussion: Greater understanding of usage and technology diffusion requires increased data transparency and granularity. Conclusion & future perspective: The use of genetic testing and molecular diagnostics will grow over the next 5 years, with uncertainty about the precise diffusion trajectory.

        "abstract": "While the development of next-generation sequencing technology has had a paradigm-changing impact on biomedical research, there is likely to be a gap between discovery of therapeutic benefits in research and actual adoption of the new technology into clinical practice. This gap can create pressure on the research enterprise to provide individualized care more typical of the clinic setting because it is uniquely accessible in research. This blurring of the line between research and clinical care is understandable, and perhaps even inevitable. But even if the gap is only transitory, such a blurring can have lasting implications, both by expanding obligations imposed on researchers, but also by challenging long-held ethical views. We explore this idea, focusing on how the dissolving distinction between research and clinical care has influenced the vigorous debate around how researchers should manage genetic findings (sometimes separated into primary and incidental or secondary findings) resulting from research.",

However, its founder, Harvard geneticist George Church, was concerned about the fact that DNA is the ultimate digital identifier \u2013 individuals and many of their traits can be identified. Therefore, he believed that promising participants privacy and confidentiality would be impractical and disingenuous. Moreover, deidentification of samples would impoverish both genotypic and phenotypic data. As a result, the PGP has arguably become best known for its unprecedented approach to informed consent. All participants must pass an exam testing their knowledge of genomic science and privacy issues and agree to forgo the privacy and confidentiality of their genomic data and personal health records.

        "abstract": "Organisms frequently encounter different environmental conditions. The physiological and behavioral responses to these conditions depend on the genetic make up of individuals. Genotype generally remains constant from one environment to another, although occasional spontaneous mutations may occur which cause it to change. However, when the same genotype is subjected to different environments, it can produce a wide range of phenotypes. These phenotypic variations are attributable to the effect of the environment on the expression and function of genes influencing the trait. Changes in the relative performance of genotypes across different environments are referred to as genotype-environment interactions (GEI). A general argument for research on the impact of GEI in common diseases is that it provides insights into disease processes at the population, individual and molecular levels. In humans, GEI is complicated by multiple factors including phenocopies, genocopies, epigenetics and imprinting. A better understanding of GEI is essential if patients are to make informed health choices guided by their genomic information. In this article, we clarify the role of the environment on phenotype, we describe how human population structure can obscure the resolution of GEI and we discuss how emerging biobanks across the globe can be coordinated to further our understanding of genotype-phenotype associations within the context of varying environment.",

Business models that allow reimbursement for diagnostics to be based on clinical utility will prove successful. Increased quantitation of diagnostics will move point-of-care testing to the physician's office. The use of diagnostics for cost reduction will grow. Outside of the traditional health system, multiple new markets will emerge.

Consumer genomics companies and those who harness rapid technology improvements, quick clinics and home devices will be part of the growing new markets.

Previously, we documented the beneficial effects of 1,2-dilinoleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DL-PC) and/or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PO-PC), which enhanced learning and memory abilities and improved cognitive disorders in both animals and humans. The present study reviews the usefulness of DL- and PO-PC for the treatment of Alzheimer dementia. Study section and results: The anti-dementia effect of DL-PC, PO-PC, or DL-PC plus PO-PC was assessed in patients with cognitive decline and dementia by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. The initial MMSE score for the patients was 17.4+/-0.3; however, 1 month after taking DL- and/or PO-PC the score increased to over 20, corresponding to normal cognitive functions, and the effect was still evident in some subjects 5 years after taking DL- and/or PO-PC. Among the subjects in this study, 20 patients with Alzheimer disease had taken donepezil hydrochloride for more than 1 year. The MMSE score for those 20 patients was 11.8+/-1.1, and the score significantly improved to 19.9+/-1.6 one year after stopping donepezil medication and instead taking DL- and PO-PC.

Our goal was to identify relevant decision aids and investigate their didactic strengths and limitations.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We included decision aids that derived individualized content from personal and clinical data provided by the patient. By conducting a systematic literature and internet research through November 2013 supplemented by expert interviews, we identified 10 decision aids of which 6 had been investigated scientifically. We compared their individual characteristics as well as the design and results of the evaluation studies.\\n\\nRESULTS: The decision aids present two to seven therapy choices, whereby radical prostatectomy and percutaneous radiotherapy are always included. Number and type of parameters provided by the patient also vary considerably. Two decision aids derive a therapeutic recommendation from the patient's input. Evaluation studies showed higher disease-related knowledge and greater confidence in the treatment decision after using one of six decision aids. Satisfaction with the decision aid was predominantly high.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Currently personalized patient decision aids for treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer are only available in English. These tools can facilitate the shared decision making process for patients and physicians. Therefore, comparable decision aids should be developed in German.",

Treatment with drugs from five classes of antihypertensives was evaluated in these studies. The duration of treatment ranged from week-long follow up for blood pressure response to a decade-long follow up for clinical outcomes. In total, associations with 12 different candidate genes were assessed. These studies present the now familiar mixture of significant and nonsignificant pharmacogenetic findings that are sometimes consistent with, sometimes inconsistent with, previous findings in antihypertensive pharmacogenetics.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Recent research in antihypertensive pharmacogenetics has added to the existing evidence base, and novel genes and variants as well as new methodologies are cause for continued optimism. However, translation of genomic science to clinical settings has not kept pace with growing interest in personalized medicine for hypertension. New research paradigms may be needed to translate pharmacogenetics into clinical tools. Clinical application will also require a trained clinical workforce, validated genetic tests, and payers willing to fund pretreatment testing.",

This change is currently not (yet) signified by the use of targeted therapy in clinical practice but more by the definition of molecular markers as predictors for response to therapy which have been used for a long time. While in the past the choice of treatment has been based solely on the tumor entity and its degree of malignancy derived from histological analyses, large randomized trials have now provided a solid basis for personalized molecular-guided treatment decisions. For instance, in the German NOA-08 trial a benefit of chemotherapy with temozolomide alone was only demonstrated in a subgroup of elderly patients with malignant gliomas displaying promoter hypermethylation of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT. This is only one of several examples where molecular analysis of tumor tissue becomes clinically relevant as these analyses can and should be taken into account for treatment decisions and not, as previously, just as an additional parameter for estimating prognosis.

Because the intervention strategy is fully integrated with an evolutionary perspective on human development, we offer it in this context. We begin with a historical overview of Millon's model and its relationship to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). We then present his basic theoretical principles and personality taxonomy, and discuss variations in personality functioning across the normal\u2013abnormal continuum. We move on to describe assessment measures that were developed to operationalize his concepts and ideas, and which are used as the basis for creating treatment plans. The premises and principles of personalized psychotherapy are described to show how the intervention model is squarely focused on the integrated unity of the person. We look at presenting problems of all kinds from the point of view of how they emanate from, and are related to, the individual's unique combination of temperament, traits, preferences, behavioral patterns, and coping strategies. We then specify multimodal interventions (e.g., a combination of pharmacologic, cognitive, behavioral, phenomenological, interpersonal, and/or intrapsychic treatments) and apply them in a particular sequence to maximize their impact, not only on the target symptoms, but on the underlying personality elements believed to be their primary cause.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Personalized sleep medicine is an emerging area of research and practice. Recent studies have identified clear inter-individual differences in performance vulnerability to sleep loss. Although clear biomarkers for this vulnerability are not known, new research indicates that genetic influences on sleep and circadian systems may be important. To assess the clnical applicabilty of these findings for diagnosis and treatment of patients with circadian rhythm disorders we summarized the present knowledge and speculate about futural developments. Materials and methods: Literature search using PubMed. Results: Dim Light melatonin Onset (DLMO) plays a key role in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm sleep disorders. It cannot be predicted by sleep parameters or polymorphisms of clock- or other sleep related genes. For melatonin treatment DLMO is crucial, as this treatment is most effective if administered at a time which is related to the DLMO. Efficacy of melatonin treatment depends not only on its personalized time of administration, but also on the speed of its metabolisation. For slow melatonin metabolisation may pile up daily melatonin levels and consequently stop melatonin efficacy. Melatonin metabolisation is influenced by CYP1A2 gene activity. Several methods to assess Cyp1A2 activity are being developed, using melatonin, coffee, green tea and chocolate as test substances or measuring CYP1A2 polymorphisms. Co-morbidities including ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) influence circadian sleep rhythm and their response to melatonin treatment. CYP1A2 polymorphisms might be correlated with slow melatonin metabolisation and ASD. Conclusion: DLMO, melatonin metabolisation tests and assessment of psychiatric co-morbidity are crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Further development of techniques to measure melatonin and its metabolisation will increase the clinical applicability. Acknowledgement: This is a non-sponsored study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\\nFor targeted radiation therapies, treatment planning is a real challenge. In fact, the activity that can be injected to the patient is limited by the dose to organs at risk (OARs) which has to be kept below the tolerance threshold. Therefore, a 3D dosimetric method (PMCD), based on Monte Carlo calculations, has been developed in order to personalize and optimize the activity prescription for Selective Internal Radiotherapy (SIRT) treatments. \\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe PMCD method was used with data from 10 patients treated for hepatic metastases. Using the OEDIPE software, regions of interest outlines, drawn on CT images, were used to create patient-specific voxel phantoms and 99mTc-MAA SPECT data were used to generate 3D-matrices of cumulated activity. The absorbed dose and biological effective dose (BED) were calculated at the voxel scale using the MCNPX Monte Carlo transport code and OEDIPE. The maximum injectable activity (MIA) was then calculated using OEDIPE depending on tolerance criteria on OARs based on mean absorbed doses, mean BED, Dose-Volume Histograms (DVHs) or BED-Volume Histograms (BVHs). Those MIAs were compared to the ones recommended by conventional methods: the Body Surface Area (BSA) method and the Partition Model with tolerance criteria on mean absorbed doses. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nPerforming a personalized dosimetry using the PMCD method enables to increase the activity prescription while ensuring OARs\u2019 radiation protection. Moreover, considering tolerance criteria based on DVHs further enhances treatment planning efficiency by taking advantage of the parallel characteristic of the liver and the lungs whose functions are not impaired if the level of irradiation to a fraction of the organ is kept below the tolerance threshold. Finally, tolerance criteria on mean BED and BVHs further improve treatment planning by taking into account biological considerations such as cell repair, radiosensibility or dose-rate distribution. \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nBesides its feasibility and applicability in clinical routine, the interest of a personalized Monte Carlo dosimetry for treatment planning in 90Y-microspheres therapies was confirmed from those patient studies.",

To achieve this goal, a close interaction between basic researchers, clinical scientists, molecular pathologists, and pharmaceutical companies is essential. We believe that this approach is worth the effort, since personalized therapy in lung cancer has the potential to substantially improve survival in an increasing number of patients. At the moment, established personalized treatment approaches include treatment of patients with NSCLC and activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations with the EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib, and treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic aberrations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) oncogene with the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET)/ALK inhibitor crizotinib. A new approach, the treatment of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-amplified squamous cell lung cancer patients with FGFR inhibitors, is currently being tested in phase I clinical trials.",

Subsequent reports revealed that IL28B genotypes also affect treatment efficacy in chronic infection with other HCV genotypes. Furthermore, there have been several reports that implicate IL28B genotypes in inflammatory status, progression of fibrosis and adverse clinical outcomes in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Therapy of CHC recently entered a new era with the deployment of direct-acting antivirals. These include nonstructural 3/4A protease inhibitors which have shown promise in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV in several clinical trials. IFN-free therapy is expected to be useful especially in IFN-resistant patients and may become the standard of care in the future. Several clinical trials have revealed an association between IL28B genotype and treatment efficacy in triple therapy or IFN-free regimens. On the other hand the mechanism of the effect of IL28B on HCV infection has not yet been elucidated. Recently, it was shown that the polymorphism of IFN-lambda 4 (IFNL4) is in high linkage disequilibrium with that of near IL28B, and more strongly associated with spontaneous or treatment-induced HCV clearance than IL28B genotypes, especially in individuals of African ancestry. This finding provides new insights into the genetic regulation of HCV clearance and its clinical management. IL28B genotyping will be also useful for personalized CHC treatment in the forthcoming era of direct-acting antivirals.",

However, the growing body of research in this field and heterogeneity across those studies could make it difficult for these candidates to be translated into treatment recommendations. Among others variety of ethnicity and therapeutic agents could play an important role as confounder in pharmacogenetic result. To contribute to personalized medication for depression we should clarify the complicated effect of these confounders. Methods: Therefore we performed meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic studies with consideration of efficacy of some factors to detect the difference of genetic influence on antidepressant response between Asian and Caucasian based on our previous meta-analysis. We also performed randomized clinical trail (RCT) in Japanese subject \u201cfluvoxamine vs. paroxetine vs. milnacipran\u201d stratified by interesting genetic factor such as functional polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene (SERTPR) and the alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2A), that we previously observed different contribution to each antidepressant. Results: From the meta-analysis, clearly different results between ethnicities were observed with HTR1A-1019C/G, HTR2A-1438A/G (102T/C) and TPH1 218A/C independent from efficacy of type antidepressant possibly due to efficacy of other polymorphisms, different allele frequency, differential effect depending on specific symptoms, and cultural or social differences between Asians and Caucasians. As for 5-HTTLPR, inconsistent result could not be observed between ethnicities but SSRIs prescribed study and others. RCT showed that in patient having both SERTPR S\u2032/S\u2032 and ADRA2A-1297C allele, fluvoxamine was significantly less effective compared to paroxetine and milnacipran, while in patient with SERTPR L\u2032 allele and ADRA2A-1297G/G, milnacipran was significantly less effective compared to paroxetine and fluvoxamine. Conclusion: Pharmacogenetic approach could contribute to, at least partially, to predict antidepressant response and personalized medication in depression with consideration of possible confounders.",

In part, failure to treat these two aggressive cancers successfully centers on the fact that while the majority of patients are diagnosed based on current surveillance strategies as having a complete clinical response to their primary therapy, nearly half will develop disease recurrence within 18 months and the majority will die from disease recurrence within 5 years. Moreover, no currently used biomarkers or imaging studies can predict outcome following initial treatment. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a theoretically powerful biomarker for detecting otherwise occult disease. We therefore explored the use of personalized ctDNA markers as both a surveillance and prognostic biomarker in gynecologic cancers and compared this to current FDA-approved surveillance tools.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Tumor and serum samples were collected at time of surgery and then throughout treatment course for 44 patients with gynecologic cancers, representing 22 ovarian cancer cases, 17 uterine cancer cases, one peritoneal, three fallopian tube, and one patient with synchronous fallopian tube and uterine cancer. Patient/tumor-specific mutations were identified using whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing and ctDNA levels quantified using droplet digital PCR. CtDNA was detected in 93.8% of patients for whom probes were designed and levels were highly correlated with CA-125 serum and computed tomography (CT) scanning results. In six patients, ctDNA detected the presence of cancer even when CT scanning was negative and, on average, had a predictive lead time of seven months over CT imaging. Most notably, undetectable levels of ctDNA at six months following initial treatment was associated with markedly improved progression free and overall survival.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Detection of residual disease in gynecologic, and indeed all cancers, represents a diagnostic dilemma and a potential critical inflection point in precision medicine. This study suggests that the use of personalized ctDNA biomarkers in gynecologic cancers can identify the presence of residual tumor while also more dynamically predicting response to treatment relative to currently used serum and imaging studies. Of particular interest, ctDNA was an independent predictor of survival in patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. Earlier recognition of disease persistence and/or recurrence and the ability to stratify into better and worse outcome groups through ctDNA surveillance may open the window for improved survival and quality and life in these cancers.",

        "abstract": "This review examines existing preclinical and clinical studies related to resiniferatoxin (RTX) and its potential uses in pain treatment. Like capsaicin, RTX is a vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) agonist, only more potent. This increased potency confers both quantitative and qualitative advantages in terms of drug action on the TRPV1 containing nerve terminal, which result in an increased efficacy and a long duration of action. RTX can be delivered by a central route of administration through injection into the subarachnoid space around the lumbosacral spinal cord. It can also be administered peripherally into a region of skin or deep tissue where primary afferents nerves terminate, or directly into a nerve trunk or a dorsal root ganglion. The central route is currently being evaluated as a treatment for intractable pain in patients with advanced cancer. Peripheral administration offers the possibility to treat a wide diversity of pain problems because of the ability to bring the treatment to the site of the pain (the peripheral generator). While not all pain disorders are appropriate for RTX, tailoring treatment to an individual patient's needs via a selective and local intervention that chemically targets a specific population of nerve terminals provides a new capability for pain therapy and a simplified and effective approach to personalized pain medicine.

Great emphasis is currently presently placed on personalized medicine, particularly by many of the most influential healthcare-linked institutions, communities, organisations and companies. Methods: Personalized medicine is an appealing terminology, meaning an individualised approach to patients for either diagnosis or treatment using the most advanced and proper scientific and technological tools, which has its basis on a consolidate literature regarding the main ways for drawing more useful information by laboratory tests. Results: A novel approach tailored around personalized medicine would allow construction of a revolutionary healthcare framework, where a list of laboratory tests adopted for each individual should be descriptive enough of the personal metabolic characteristics, as to be useful in a lifelong perspective, with the needed adjustments due to peculiar genetic variations and/or diseases. Conclusions: By a \"personalized\" approach, supported by informatics and computer science, each individual would benefit of an \"in progress\" assessment and the variations from the steady state timely evidenced and acknowledged. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a considerable body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of personalized feedback interventions for hazardous alcohol use-whether delivered face-to-face, by postal mail, or over the Internet (probably now the primary mode of delivery). The Check Your Drinking Screener (CYD; see www.CheckYourDrinking.net) is one such intervention. OBJECTIVES: The current treatment dismantling study assessed which components of personalized feedback interventions were effective in motivating change in drinking. Specifically, the major objective of this project was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the impact of the normative feedback and other personalized feedback components of the CYD intervention in the general population. METHODS: Participants were recruited to take part in an RCT and received either the complete CYD final report, just the normative feedback sections of the CYD, just the personalized feedback components of the CYD, or were assigned to a no-intervention control group. Participants were followed-up at 3 months to assess changes in alcohol consumption. RESULTS: A total of 741 hazardous drinking participants were recruited for the trial, of which 73 percent provided follow-up data. Analyses using an intent-to-treat approach found some evidence for the impact of the personalized feedback components of the CYD in reducing alcohol consumption on the variables, number of drinks in a week and AUDIT-C (p = .028 and .047 respectively; no impact on highest number of drinks on one occasion; p = .594). However, there was no significant evidence of the impact of the normative feedback components (all p > .3). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized feedback elements alone could provide an active intervention for hazardous drinkers, particularly in situations where normative feedback information was not available.

We suggest an approach for determining an optimal anticancer drug delivery scenario for cancer patients without prior knowledge of nonlinear model structure and parameters by compounding State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) and MRAC which will lead to personalized drug administration. Several approaches have been proposed for eradicating cancerous cells in nonlinear tumor growth model. The main difficulty in these approaches is the requirement of nonlinear model parameters, which are unknown to physicians in reality. To cope with this shortage, we first determine the drug delivery scenario for a reference patient with known mathematical model and parameters via SDRE technique, and by using the proposed approach we adapt the drug administration scenario for another cancer patient despite unknown nonlinear model structure and model parameters. We propose an efficient approach to determine drug administration which will help physicians for prescribing a chemotherapy protocol for a cancer patient by regulating the drug delivery scenario of the reference patient. Stabilizing the tumor growth nonlinear model has been achieved via full state feedback techniques and yields a near optimal solution to cancer treatment problem. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for eradicating tumor lumps with different sizes in different patients.",

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is highly addictive, and modern genetic research has identified robust genetic influences on nicotine dependence. An important step in translating these genetic findings is to identify the genetic factors affecting smoking cessation in order to enhance current smoking cessation treatments. We review the significance of variants in the nicotinic receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4) in the prediction of smoking quantity, smoking cessation, and response to cessation medication in multiple studies of smoking cessation. Three common haplotypes (low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk) in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region are defined by rs16969968 and rs680244. The genetic variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region that predict nicotine dependence also predict a later age of smoking cessation in a community-based sample. In a smoking cessation trial, these variants predict abstinence at end of treatment in individuals receiving placebo medication, but not amongst individuals receiving active medication. Pharmacological treatments moderate the genetic risk in affecting cessation success. These pharmacogenetic interactions have been reproduced by a recent meta-analysis of smoking cessation trials. The number needed to treat (NNT) is 4 for smokers with the high-risk haplotype, 7 for smokers with the intermediate-risk haplotype, and >1000 for smokers with the low-risk haplotype. The wide variation in NNT between smokers with different haplotypes supports the notion that personalized smoking cessation intervention based upon genotype could meaningfully increase the efficiency of such treatment. In summary, variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region identify individuals at increased risk of cessation failure, and this increased risk can be ameliorated by cessation pharmacotherapy.",

A total of 178 patients were recruited from two major hospitals that provided MMTP services in southern Taiwan, and information regarding concomitant medications and diseases was acquired from the National Health Insurance (NHI) program. The results demonstrated that the methadone maintenance dose, CYP2B6 785G allele, and ABCB1 2677T allele have positive effects on the methadone plasma concentration. In contrast, patients with HCV coinfection, alcohol problems, and psychiatric diseases may have a negative response to treatment. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of treatment responses in the MMTP should include not only genetic polymorphisms in methadone metabolism and transporter proteins, but also concomitant diseases, MDIs, and poly-substance use. The results also suggest that personalized medicine may be indispensable for a better outcome of the MMTP.",

        "abstract": "This article considers the issue of personalized drug discovery for the orphan disease cystic fibrosis (CF) to deliver a candidate for therapeutic development. CF is a very complicated disease due to numerous anomalies of the gene leading to progressive severity and morbidity. Despite extensive research efforts, 20 years after the cloning of the CF gene, CF patients are still waiting for a curative treatment as prescribed medications still target the secondary manifestations of the disease rather than the gene or the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. New therapeutics aimed at improving mutant CFTR functions, also known as 'protein repair therapy' are nevertheless hoped and predicted to replace some of the currently used therapy, while improving the quality of life as well as life expectancy of CF patients. Although there is substantial variability in the cost of treating CF between countries, a protein repair therapy should also alleviate the financial burden of medical costs for CF patients and their families. Finding new drugs or rediscovering old ones for CF is critically dependent on the delivery of molecular and structural information on the CFTR protein, on its mutated version and on the network of CFTR-interacting proteins. The expertise needed to turn compounds into marketable drugs for CF will depend on our ability to provide biological information obtained from pertinent models of the disease and on our success in transferring safe molecules to clinical trials. Predicting a drug-induced response is also an attractive challenge that could be rapidly applied to patients.",

A HERV protein, the multiple sclerosis\u2013associated retrovirus (MSRV) envelope protein (MSRV-Env), is expressed in the blood and active brain lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. It possesses pro-inflammatory and myelinotoxic properties. The patterns of expression and pathogenic properties of MSRV-Env make it a relevant drug target for MS therapeutics \u2014 in particular for pre- venting neurodegeneration, a key component of progres- sive forms of MS. An immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), called GNbAC1, has been developed to neutralize this pathogenic target. After showing neutralizing effects in vitro and in mouse models of MS, GNbAC1 is now in phase II clinical development. MSRV-related biomarkers such as MSRV-Env and MSRV polymerase (MSRV-Pol) gene transcripts are overexpressed in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS. These biomarkers may have prognostic value for long-term MS evolution, and their transcription levels in blood decline during treatments with GNbAC1, which has also been reported in patients administered reference MS drugs such as natalizumab or interferon-b. GNbAC1 as a new MSRV- Env-antagonist mAb could be a specific and causal treatment for MS, with a particular application for pro- gressive forms of the disease. For possible use in companion diagnostic tests, MSRV-associated biomarkers could open the door to a personalized therapeutic approach for MS.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The quality of radiotherapy treatment plans varies across institutions and depends on the experience of the planner. For the purpose of intra- and inter-institutional homogenization of treatment plan quality, we present an algorithm that learns the organs-at-risk (OARs) sparing patterns from a database of high quality plans. Thereafter, the algorithm predicts the dose that similar organs will receive in future radiotherapy plans prior to treatment planning on the basis of the anatomies of the organs. The predicted dose provides the basis for the individualized specification of planning objectives, and for the objective assessment of the quality of radiotherapy plans.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: One hundred and twenty eight (128) Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) plans were selected from a database of prostate cancer plans. The plans were divided into two groups, namely a training set that is made up of 95 plans and a validation set that consists of 33 plans. A multivariate analysis technique was used to determine the relationships between the positions of voxels and their dose. This information was used to predict the likely sparing of the OARs of the plans of the validation set. The predicted doses were visually and quantitatively compared to the reference data using dose volume histograms, the 3D dose distribution, and a novel evaluation metric that is based on the dose different test.\\n\\nRESULTS: A voxel of the bladder on the average receives a higher dose than a voxel of the rectum in optimized radiotherapy plans for the treatment of prostate cancer in our institution if both voxels are at the same distance to the PTV. Based on our evaluation metric, the predicted and reference dose to the bladder agree to within 5% of the prescribed dose to the PTV in 18 out of 33 cases, while the predicted and reference doses to the rectum agree to within 5% in 28 out of the 33 plans of the validation set.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We have described a method to predict the likely dose that OARs will receive before treatment planning. This prospective knowledge could be used to implement a global quality assurance system for personalized radiation therapy treatment planning.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Great efforts have been made to predict disease behavior over time and the response to treatment in Crohn's disease (CD). Such understanding could personalize therapy. Early introduction of more aggressive therapies to patients at high risk and no introduction of predictable refractory treatments could become possible. We hence tested the influence of the NOD2 carrier status on treatment response.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In 185 CD patients (age 45 \u00b1 9.8 years, female n = 108, minimum disease duration 10 years), the three most common polymorphisms (p.Arg702Trp, p.Gly908Arg, p.Leu1007fsX1008) of NOD2 were tested by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Detailed clinical and medical history were obtained with a standardized questionnaire and by reviewing the medical charts. Treatments introduced were chosen by physicians blinded to genotype data.\\n\\nRESULTS: The frequency of the NOD2 variant allele was about one-third (67, 30.2%) of CD patients. NOD2 carriers were more often treated with systemic and locally active steroids and with an immunosuppressant (Azathioprine/6-MP). NOD2 mutation carrier status was more often associated with systemic steroid [8.9% vs. wild-type (WT) 1.2%, P = 0.0086] and local-steroid refractory (14.9% vs. WT 3.5%; P = 0.001). The WT patients were significantly higher refractory to immunosuppressant (12.8% vs. NOD2 carriers, 0.5%, P = 0.03). Most WT patients were treated with TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and remission rates were significantly higher in this group after 1 year of treatment (84% vs. NOD2 carriers, 33%, P = 0.07).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The study presents first hints for the NOD2 carrier status to be predictive for response to therapy. A higher percentage of CD patients with NOD2 mutation carrier status was steroid refractory but could be treated well with immunosuppressants. The WT status showed a higher response to steroids and remission rates within 1 year of anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy. On the way to personalized medicine, this approach should be further investigated in larger studies.",

The 54,157 participants (median age of 58 years) were screened for heavy drinking. Of the 3418 participants who had a weekly alcohol consumption above 14 drinks for women and 21 drinks for men, 1380 (619 women) consented to take part in the trial and were randomly assigned to an Internet-based brief personalized feedback intervention group (normative feedback, n = 476), an Internet-based personalized brief advice intervention group (n = 450), or a nonintervention control group (n = 454). Follow-up after 6 and 12 months included 871 and 1064 participants, respectively, of all groups combined. The outcome measure was self-reported weekly alcohol consumption. We analyzed the data according to the intention-to-treat principle. To examine changes over time and to account for the multiple time measurements, we used a multilevel linear mixed model. To take attrition into account, we used multiple imputation to address missing data.\\n\\nRESULTS: The intervention effect of the Internet-based brief personalized feedback intervention, determined as the mean additional difference in changes in alcohol consumption in the Internet-based brief personalized feedback intervention compared with the control group, was -1.8 drinks/week after 6 months and -1.4 drinks/week after 12 months; these effects were nonsignificant (95% confidence interval -4.0 to 0.3 at 6 months, -3.4 to 0.6 at 12 months). The intervention effect of the Internet-based personalized brief advice intervention was -0.5 drinks/week after 6 months and -1.2 drinks/week after 12 months; these effects were nonsignificant (95% confidence interval -2.7 to 1.6 at 6 months, -3.3 to 0.9 at 12 months).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial we found no evidence that an Internet-based brief personalized feedback intervention was effective in reducing drinking in an adult population of heavy drinkers.\\n\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00751985; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00751985 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/68WCRLyaP).",

Currently about 15% of NSCLC patients benefit from improved treatment protocols based on the genetic background of the tumor. In the last few years cancer immunotherapy has returned to the center of attention and comprises a variety of treatment approaches incorporating adaptive, as well as innate immunity. Current strategies involve the use of monoclonal antitumor antibodies, cancer vaccines, adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated T and NK cells as well as the blockade of so-called immune checkpoints (immune inhibitory pathways). Especially the combination of current treatments with immunotherapy seems promising to achieve highly potent antitumor effects. However, a profound understanding of the dynamic and complex interaction between lung cancer and the host immune system and especially its immune checkpoints is the foundation to identify potential biomarkers for a personalized cancer immunotherapy approach.",

        "abstract": "Prophylaxis is the recommended treatment for people with severe haemophilia. It is unlikely that a single prophylactic regimen, for example based on weight, would be optimal for all patients and therefore each individual should have a personalized regimen, agreed between themselves and their haemophilia centre. This regimen should take into account the individual\u2019s bleeding pattern, the condition of their musculoskeletal system, level and timing of physical activity and measurement of coagulation factor in their blood. It is important to recognize that prophylactic regimens are likely to need to change with time as the circumstances of an individual change. For example, activity may change with age or with the season and an individual\u2019s factor VIII pharmacokinetics vary with age. Knowledge of a patient\u2019s pharmacokinetics is likely to help personalize prophylaxis when combined with other information. Factor VIII pharmacokinetics are simple to measure in routine clinical practice and can be adequately calculated from 2 to 3 blood samples combined with a simple to use computer program. Prophylaxis is expensive and, in countries with a limited health care budget, ways to improve its cost effectiveness need to be considered to allow increased access to this treatment. For example, increasing the frequency of prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the amount of treatment required to sustain measureable factor levels and hence reduce cost. The introduction of longer-acting coagulation factors may necessitate a change in concepts about prophylaxis because whilst these agents may sustain an apparently adequate trough level with fewer infusions, the length of time a person spends at a low level will be increased and this could increase the risk of bleeding, especially at the time of increased physical activity. There is convincing evidence that prophylaxis is the optimal therapy for severe haemophilia, optimizing treatment for each individual and increasing access to this treatment modality are important goals for the future.",

Consideration of human genetic variation in the post-genomics era increased the rate of discovery of novel therapeutic targets that could become the mainstay of personalized anti-cancer treatment. These targets include tumour suppressor genes such as tumour protein (TP)53, as well as oncogenes and cell cycle genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MYC, protein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN2A) genes. Polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450, excision repair cross-complementing (ERCC) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA) genes strongly influence the risk of developing lung cancer, and the risk attributable to these polymorphisms differs in non-smokers compared to smokers. Variants in the EGFR gene occur more frequently among women and non-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, and are strongly associated with sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib. Polymorphisms in the ERCC1, ATP-binding cassette, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, cytidine deaminase and ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 genes influence the metabolism, clinical efficacy and/or toxicity of other drugs used to treat lung cancer, including cisplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan and gemcitabine. This review presents a critical synthesis of the major genetic changes associated with lung carcinogenesis, as well as the significance of pharmacogenetics approaches to forecast therapeutic response in lung cancer. We underscore that mechanism-based associations of human genetic variation with pharmacodynamics of current and emerging medicines will provide additional decision tools for anti-cancer pharmacotherapy to be personalized in clinical care of patients with lung cancer.

In one study, we have been able to determine the oncogenic mechanisms driving a rare adenocarcinoma of the tongue and provide clinically useful information to aid in its treatment, through the determination that the cancer was driven primarily by activation of the RET pathway. The administration of RET targeting kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and sorafenib, provided tumour stabilisation for several months, after which time therapeutic resistant tumours arose. This provided us with the opportunity to identify the genetic changes associated with drug resistance allowing the observation that resistance is correlated with an apparent up-regulation of the parallel proliferative AKT pathway. However, the complete and comprehensive analysis of a genome using this technology is still nascent and many of the software tools required to achieve this are still in development. In the analysis of tumour normal pairs, it is not clear that current levels of sampling are sufficient to identify somatic changes accurately without further validation. Likewise, the level of false negatives that confound our analyses is unclear. Such considerations will be important if this technology is to be adopted in the routine provision of personalized medicine",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of activated charcoal in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, and to estimate the changes of lactobacilli in the vagina. \\n\\nMETHODS\\n1) An unblinded prospective randomized controlled 10-day trial was designed. This study included 64 women, aged 18\u201337 (mean age, 28 years) with newly diagnosed bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using the Amsel criteria. The subjects with complete lack of vaginal lactobacilli at baseline (6/70) were excluded from the study. Patients with bacterial vaginosis were divided in two groups, one group was treated with trans-vaginal tampons containing a 10% solution of activated charcoal, the other one as a control received a chloramphenicol (100\u00a0mg) vaginal suppository. \\n\\nRESULTS\\n1) In the group treated with chloramphenicol, lactobacilli were completely lost in 84.3% of the subjects (27/32), whereas only 3.1% (1/32) of the subjects treated with activated charcoal showed this loss; the difference was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test). 2) Both treatments successfully reduced the amount of vaginal secretion. 3) Both treatments showed significant improvements in the magnitude of malodor. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn the present study, a novel treatment with activated charcoal tampons showed remarkable improvements of the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. This approach is a potentially promising treatment for this infection without adverse effects.",

Addition of chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to chemotherapy significantly improved efficacy including overall survival (OS) in untreated fit patients; humanized anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab and fully human anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab lead to improvement in refractory disease. Novel small molecule inhibitors such as ibrutinib and idelalisib demonstrated excellent activity and were very recently licensed in relapsed/refractory CLL. Obinutuzumab (GA101) is the newest monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of CLL. This novel, glycoengineered, type II humanized anti-CD20 antibody is characterized by enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and direct induction of cell death compared to type I antibodies. Combination of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil yielded significantly better OS in comparison to chlorambucil monotherapy in untreated comorbid patients. These results led to approval of obinuzutumab for the treatment of CLL. Numerous clinical trials combining obinutuzumab with other cytotoxic drugs and novel small molecules are currently under way. This review focuses on the role of obinutuzumab in the treatment of CLL.",

Key questions in this algorithm relate to the question whether the patient is a primary vs a secondary non-responder to TNF blockade and whether the patient is RF and/or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive.

CKD encompasses a poor prognosis related to a remarkable number of comorbidities, and many patients suffer from this disease progression. Once the factors linked with CKD evolution are distinguished, it will be possible to provide and enhance a more intensive treatment to high-risk patients. In this review, we focus on the emerging markers that might be predictive or related to CKD progression physiopathology as well as those related to a different pattern of response to treatment, such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers; the vitamin D receptor agonist; salt sensitivity hypertension; and progressive kidney-disease markers with identified genetic polymorphisms). Candidate-gene association studies and genome-wide association studies have analyzed the genetic basis for common renal diseases, including CKD and related factors such as diabetes and hypertension. This review will, in brief, consider genotype-based pharmacotherapy, risk prediction, drug target recognition, and personalized treatments, and will mainly focus on findings in CKD patients. An improved understanding will smooth the progress of switching from classical clinical medicine to gene-based medicine.",

However, considerable barriers exist, which may hinder the effective utilization of WGS information in a routine clinical care setting. Clinical decision support (CDS) offers a potential solution to overcome such barriers and to facilitate the effective use of WGS information in the clinic. However, genomic information is complex and will require significant considerations when developing CDS capabilities. As such, this manuscript lays out a conceptual framework for a CDS architecture designed to deliver WGS-guided CDS within the clinical workflow. To handle the complexity and breadth of WGS information, the proposed CDS framework leverages service-oriented capabilities and orchestrates the interaction of several independently-managed components. These independently-managed components include the genome variant knowledge base, the genome database, the CDS knowledge base, a CDS controller and the electronic health record (EHR). A key design feature is that genome data can be stored separately from the EHR. This paper describes in detail: (1) each component of the architecture; (2) the interaction of the components; and (3) how the architecture attempts to overcome the challenges associated with WGS information. We believe that service-oriented CDS capabilities will be essential to using WGS information for personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "More than 40 million patients annually undergo surgery in the US, at a cost of $450 billion. Although improvements in resuscitation, anesthesia, and critical care have made impor-tant contributions to survival following major surgery and trauma, approximately one million patients per year sustain medical complications after surgery, resulting in annual costs of $25 billion. The proportion of the US population older than 65 is predicted to double in the next two decades (to 20% of the overall population), leading to a 25% increase in the num-ber of surgeries, a 50% increase in surgery-related costs, and a 100% increase in complications from surgery. This acceler-ated aging of the population, combined with increased reli-ance on surgery for the treatment of disease, has resulted in a significant surgical burden. Meanwhile, pre-surgical risk pro-filing remains inconsistent and by definition not personalized, so more robust prognostic markers are needed to improve the quality of surgical care (Mangano, 2004). The perioperative period represents a unique and extreme example of gene\u2013environment interaction. As we appreciate in our daily practice in the operating rooms and intensive care units, one hallmark of perioperative physiol-ogy is the striking variability in patient responses to the acute, robust, and systemic perturbations induced by surgical injury or trauma. Further complicating factors include the some-times profound hemodynamic challenges, transient limb/ organ ischemia, partial/total organ resection, a multitude of organ system support technologies (vascular cannulation, extracorporeal circulation, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsa-tion, mechanical ventilation), transfusions, anesthetic agents, and the pharmacopoeia used in the perioperative period.",

The root of CF contains forskolin, a biologically active compound that has been demonstrated to improve well-being in some individuals by promoting lean body mass and supporting healthy metabolic function. We conducted an open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of CF root extract for weight management. \\n\\nMETHODS\\nAfter obtaining informed consent, 15 healthy volunteers participated in an 8-week open-label study. The subjects received 500\u00a0mg of CF extract (10% forskolin) twice a day with their meals. Body composition measurements were conducted using a bioelectric impedance analyzer once each week. Body weight (kg), fat content (kg), lean body mass (kg), and basal metabolic rate (kcal/day) were also measured and documented. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nOf the 15 subjects, 12 (mean age 32.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 years) completed the study. Significant decreases compared with baseline were observed after 8 weeks for body mass index (BMI) (24.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.87 to 23.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86\u00a0kg/m2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0038), body weight (66.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.00 to 63.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.10\u00a0kg, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0038), fat content (29.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.19 to 27.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.27\u00a0kg, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0038), lean body mass (44.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.98 to 43.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.01\u00a0kg, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0044) and basal metabolic rate (1379.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a074.4 to 1363.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a077.5\u00a0kcal, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0254). \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThese findings suggest that CF root extract has potential as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of obesity. Further studies using double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled designs are warranted to conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of CF root extract in personalized supplements and/or pharmacological interventions.",

CYP2C19 has genetic polymorphisms, associated with extensive, poor, intermediate or ultra-rapid metabolism of proton pump inhibitors. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 could be of clinical concern in the treatment of peptic ulcers with proton pump inhibitors.\\n\\nAIM: To investigate the frequencies of CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, and CYP2C19*17 alleles and genotypes in Russian patients with peptic ulcers.\\n\\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 971 patients of Caucasian origin with Russian nationality from Moscow region with endoscopically and histologically proven ulcers, 428 males (44%) and 543 females (56%). The mean age was 44.6\u00b111.9 years (range: 15-88 years). DNA was extracted from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid whole blood samples (10 mL). The polymorphisms CYP2C19 681G.A (CYP2C19*2, rs4244285), CYP2C19 636 G.A (CYP2C19*3, rs4986893) and CYP2C19 -806 C.T (CYP2C19*17, rs12248560) were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction.\\n\\nRESULTS: Regarding CYP2C19 genotype, 317 patients (32.65%) out of 971 were CYP2C19*1/*1 carriers classified as extensive metabolizers. Three hundred and eighty-six (39.75%) with CYP2C19*1/*17 or CYP2C19*17/*17 genotype were ultra-rapid metabolizers. Two hundred and fifty-one people (25.85%) were intermediate metabolizers with CYP2C19*1/*2, CYP2C19*2/*17, CYP2C19*1/*3, CYP2C19*3/*17 genotypes. Seventeen patients (1.75%) with CYP2C19*2/*2, CYP2C19*3/*3, CYP2C19*2/*3 genotypes were poor metabolizers. The allele frequencies were the following: CYP2C19*2 - 0.140, CYP2C19*3 - 0.006, CYP2C19*17 - 0.274.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: There is a high frequency of CYP2C19 genotypes associated with modified response to proton pump inhibitors in Russian patients with peptic ulcers.

The adoption of personalized medicine will require changes in healthcare infrastructure, diagnostics and therapeutics business models, reimbursement policy from government and private payers, and a different approach to regulatory oversight. Personalized medicine will shift medical practices upstream from the reactive treatment of disease, to proactive healthcare management including screening, early treatment, and prevention, and will alter the roles of both physician and patient. It will create a greater reliance on electronic medical records and decision support systems in an industry that has a long history of resistance to information technology. Personalized medicine requires a systems approach to implementation. But in a healthcare economy that is highly decentralized and market driven, it is incumbent upon the stakeholders themselves to advocate for a consistent set of policies and legislation that pave the way for the adoption of personalized medicine. To address this need, the Personalized Medicine Coalition (PMC) was formed as a nonprofit umbrella organization of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, and information technology companies, healthcare providers and payers, patient advocacy groups, industry policy organizations, major academic institutions, and government agencies. The PMC provides a structure for achieving consensus positions among these stakeholders on crucial public policy issues, a role which will be vital to translating personalized medicine into widespread clinical practice. In this article, we outline the goals of the PMC, and the strategies it will take to foster communication, debate, and consensus on issues such as genetic discrimination, the reimbursement structures for pharmacogenomic drugs and diagnostics, regulation, physician training and medical school curricula, and public education. \u00a9 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

The sample included women (N = 379) with newly-diagnosed breast cancer undergoing treatment at a Midwestern university-affiliated cancer center. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using the Lymphedema and Breast Cancer Questionnaire at time of diagnosis, post-operatively, quarterly during the first year, and then semi-annually thereafter through 30 months post-treatment. A mixed-methodology was used to analyze participants\u2019 comments. Themes central to long-term survivorship experiences included social support, positive worldviews, breast cancer and lymphedema health literacy, religious/spiritual beliefs, self-empowerment, and recovery expectations. These themes were consistent with a psychoneuroimmunological model of health in which psychosocial variables mediate stress and influence health outcomes. Qualitative data showed that social support and positive worldviews were the two themes with the most significant impact on long-term breast cancer survivorship experiences. Survivors expressed a need to advance their health care literacy in order to share ownership of breast cancer and lymphedema treatment decisions. Since breast cancer is an immune-mediated disease, long-term survivorship planning should address psychosocial factors that influence the long-term psychological distress associated with immune dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetic variability in ABCB1, encoding the P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, has been linked to altered methadone maintenance treatment dose requirements. However, subsequent studies have indicated that additional environmental or genetic factors may confound ABCB1 pharmacogenetics in different methadone maintenance treatment settings. There is evidence that genetic variability in OPRM1, encoding the mu opioid receptor, and ABCB1 may interact to affect morphine response in opposite ways. This study aimed to examine whether a similar gene-gene interaction occurs for methadone in methadone maintenance treatment. METHODS: Opioid-dependent subjects (n = 119) maintained on methadone (15-300 mg/day) were genotyped for five single nucleotide polymorphisms of ABCB1 (61A > G; 1199G > A; 1236C > T; 2677G > T; 3435C > T), as well as for the OPRM1 118A > G single nucleotide polymorphism. Subjects' methadone doses and trough plasma (R)-methadone concentrations (C(trough)) were compared between ABCB1 haplotypes (with and without controlling for OPRM1 genotype), and between OPRM1 genotypes (with and without controlling for ABCB1 haplotype). RESULTS: Among wild-type OPRM1 subjects, an ABCB1 variant haplotype group (subjects with a wild-type and 61A:1199G:1236C:2677T:3435T haplotype combination, or homozygous for the 61A:1199G:1236C:2677T:3435T haplotype) had significantly lower doses (median +/- standard deviation 35 +/- 5 versus 180 +/- 65 mg/day, P < 0.01) and C(trough) (78 +/- 22 versus 177 +/- 97 ng/mL, P < 0.05) than ABCB1 wild-type subjects. Among subjects with the most common ABCB1 haplotype combination (wild-type with 61A:1199G:1236T:2677T:3435T), the OPRM1 118 A/G genotype was associated with a significantly higher C(trough) than 118 A/A (250 +/- 126 versus 108 +/- 36 ng/mL, P = 0.016). No ABCB1 haplotype group or OPRM1 genotype was associated with dose or C(trough) without taking into account confounding genetic variability at the other locus. Therefore, two interacting pharmacogenetic determinants of methadone maintenance treatment response were identified, ie, ABCB1, where variants are associated with lower methadone requirements, and OPRM1, where the variant is associated with higher methadone requirements. CONCLUSION: These opposing pharmacogenetic effects therefore need to be considered in combination when assessing methadone maintenance treatment pharmacogenetics.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality rate of any gynecologic cancer, and patients generally have a poor prognosis due to high chemotherapy resistance and late stage disease diagnosis. Platinum-resistant OC can be treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy such as paclitaxel, topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and gemcitabine, but many patients eventually relapse upon treatment. Fortunately, there are currently a number of targeted therapies in development for these patients who have shown promising results in recent clinical trials. These treatments often target the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway (eg, bevacizumab and aflibercept), DNA repair mechanisms (eg, iniparib and olaparib), or they are directed against folate related pathways (eg, pemetrexed, farletuzumab, and vintafolide). As many targeted therapies are only effective in a subset of patients, there is an increasing need for the identification of response predictive biomarkers. Selecting the right patients through biomarker screening will help tailor therapy to patients and decrease superfluous treatment to those who are biomarker negative; this approach should lead to improved clinical results and decreased toxicities. In this review the current targeted therapies used for treating platinum-resistant OC are discussed. Furthermore, use of prognostic and response predictive biomarkers to define OC patient populations that may benefit from specific targeted therapies is also highlighted.",

We prospectively enrolled 140 women and followed the participants for 12 months after surgery to investigate patterns of obesity and lymph fluid level in the first year of cancer treatment. Electrical bioimpedance devices were used to measure weight, BMI, and percent of body fat as well as lymph fluid level. General instructions were given to the participants on maintaining pre-surgery weight. Among the 140 participants, 136 completed the study with 2.9% attrition. More than 60% of the participants were obese (30.8%) or overweight (32.4%), while only two participants were underweight and about 35% had normal weight. This pattern of obesity and overweight was consistent at 4\u20138 weeks and 12 months post-surgery. At 12 months post-surgery, the majority of the women (72.1%) maintained pre-surgery weight and 15.4% had &gt;5% weight loss; 12.5% of the women increase &gt;5% of their weight. Significantly more patients in the obesity group had lymphedema defined by L-Dex ratio &gt;7.1 than those in the normal/underweight and overweight group at pre-surgery and 4\u20138 weeks post-surgery. There was a trend of more patients in the obesity group had L-Dex ratio &gt;7.1 at 12 months post-surgery. Obesity and overweight remain among women at the time of cancer diagnosis and the patterns of obesity and overweight continue during the first year of treatment. General instructions on having nutrition-balanced and portion-appropriate diet and physical activities daily or weekly can be effective to maintain pre-surgery weight.",

Personalized medicine is particularly important in oncology, whereby most clinically used anticancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic window and exhibit a large interindividual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. This variability can be explained, at least in part, by genetic variations in the genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or drug targets. Understanding of how genetic variations influence drug disposition and action could help in tailoring cancer therapy based on individual's genetic makeup. This review focuses on the pharmacogenomics of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, with a particular highlight of examples whereby genetic variations in the metabolizing enzymes and transporters influence the pharmacokinetics and/or response of chemotherapeutic agents.",

The average survival time of these patients only have 6-8 months with chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to explore and summarize the probability of detection of micrometastasis in peripheral blood for molecular staging, and for selection of indication of surgical treatment, and beneficiary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative adjuvant therapy in locally advanced lung cancer; to summarize the long-time survival result of personalized surgical treatment of 516 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer based on molecular staging methods.CK19 mRNA expression of peripheral blood samples was detected in 516 lung cancer patients by RT-PCR before operation for molecular diagnosis of micrometastasis, personalized molecular staging, and for selection of indication of surgical treatment and the beneficiary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer invaded heart, great vessels or both. The long-term survival result of personalized surgical treatment was retrospectively analyzed in 516 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer based on molecular staging methods.There were 322 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 194 cases with adenocarcinoma in the series of 516 patients with locally advanced lung cancer involved heart, great vessels or both. There were 112 patients with IIIA disease and 404 cases with IIIB disease according to P-TNM staging. There were 97 patients with M-IIIA disease, 278 cases with M-IIIB disease and 141 cases with III disease according to our personalized molecular staging. Of the 516 patients, bronchoplastic procedures and pulmonary artery reconstruction was carried out in 256 cases; lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of partial left atrium was performed in 41 cases; Double sleeve lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of super vena cava was carried out in 90 cases; Lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of diaphragm was performed in 3 cases; Double sleeve lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of partial left atrium was performed in 30 cases; Bronchoplastic procedures and pulmonary artery reconstruction combined with reconstruction of aorta sheath was carried out in 10 cases; Right pneumonectomy combined with resection and reconstruction partial left atrium, total right diaphragm with Dacron, and post cava and right liver vein was performed in one case; Lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of carina was carried out in 10 cases; Bronchoplastic procedures and pulmonary artery reconstruction combined with resection and reconstruction of carina and superior vane cava, or combined with superior vena cava and left atrium, or with carina and left atrium was performed in 55 cases in this series. Five patients died of operative complications and the operative mortality was 0.97%. CK19 mRNA expression was found in 141 patients. The positive rate of CK19 mRNA expression was 27.3% in peripheral blood samples in the 516 cases. The positive rates of micrometastasis in peripheral blood was significantly related to histological classification, P-TNM staging and N staging of the cancer (P < 0.05), but not to age, sex, smoking status of the patients, and size of primary tumor, and locations of the tumor (P > 0.05). The median survival time was 43.74 months. The 1, 3, 5 and 10 year survival rates of the 516 cases was 89.1%, 39.3%, 19.8% and 10.4%, respectively. The postoperative survival rate was remarkably correlated with micrometastasis in peripheral blood, histological classification of the tumor, size of primary cancer and lymph mode involvement (P < 0.05). The results of multivariable Cox model analysis showed that \"personalized molecular P-TNM staging\", micrometastasis in peripheral blood, pathological types of the tumor and mediastinal lymph node metastasis of the cancer were the most significant factors for predicting prognosis in the patients with locally advanced nonsmall lung cancer.(1) Micrometastasis was existed in peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer, which can not be detected with conventional methods. (2) Detecting of CK19 mRNA expression in peripheral blood in lung cancer patients can be used for diagnosis of micrometastasis of lung cancer and \"molecular staging\" and \"molecular P-TNM staging\" for lung cancer patients. It will be helpful for selection of surgical treatment indication, the beneficiary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative adjuvant therapy in the patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

It is less clear whether the diagnostic industry can routinely undertake the work necessary to provide evidence as to the clinical utility and economic value of its products.

Unfortunately, more than 10 years into the targeted molecular therapy era, successes have been infrequent, and toxicity remains largely unchanged compared with relatively indiscriminant, traditional chemotherapy. Emerging data suggests that the malignant clonal heterogeneity within solid tumors is so diverse that targeting one or even several mutations is likely to have minimal, transient impact. In recent years, new therapies have emerged that can effectively stimulate the immune system and improve survival in patients with metastatic disease. Through immune activation, there is the potential to target the cancer with a biologic diversity that can potentially rival the multiplicity of malignant mutations within tumors.

While survey data, (Personalization Consortium, 2000; Personalization Consortium, 2001), user studies (Karat, et al, 2003), and experience (Manber, 2000) indicate that many individuals appreciate personalization and find it useful, personalization also raises a number of privacy concerns ranging from user discomfort with a computer inferring information about them based on their purchases to concerns about co-workers, identity thieves, or the government gaining access to personalization profiles. In some cases users will provide personal data to web sites in order to receive a personalized service, despite their privacy concerns; in other cases users may turn away from a site because of privacy concerns (Ackerman, et al., 1999; Culnan and Milne, 2001; Cyber Dialogue, 2001, Berk, 2003). As recent studies have suggested that the benefits to a web site of offering personalized services often do not outweigh the costs (Berk, 2003), it is important to consider ways of designing personalization systems that will maximize the return on the investment. Improving the privacy associated with these systems so that web site visitors are more willing to trust and use them is a step in that direction. This chapter begins with a discussion of the privacy risks associated with personalization. It then provides an overview of the fair information practice principles and discusses how they may be applied to the design of personalization systems, and introduces privacy laws and self-regulatory guidelines relevant to personalization. Finally, the chapter describes a number of approaches to personalization system design that can reduce privacy risks.",

Genetic counselors are an ideal group to study when designing tools to support cancer P4 Medicine activities more broadly. The goal for this work was to gain a better understanding of the information cancer genetic counselors seek from their patients to facilitate effective information exchange for discussing risk. This was an analysis of a qualitative data set from interviews of eight cancer genetic counselors, recruited from three institutions. Genetic counselors at each site were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire. A selective coding approach was used to determine major themes associated with genetic counseling information needs for communicating risk. We generated a model for understanding categories of genetic counseling information needs to support risk communication activities. Common activities for risk communication included risk assessment and tailoring communication. Categories of information needs included: (a) clinical patient characteristics, (b) social and cognitive patient characteristics and (c) patient motivation and goals for the genetic counseling session. A logical next step is for this model to inform the design of software systems for pre-visit patient planning and delivering just-in-time educational information to facilitate cancer risk communication activities.",

These efforts depend to a large degree on the availability of a knowledge foundation. Unfortunately, existing knowledge linking cancer drugs and potential efficacy biomarkers is in its infancy; and where links are known, they are frequently unstructured and poorly documented. We have developed a new open-access knowledgebase for precision cancer medicine (the PCM Wiki and Knowledgebase). This knowledgebase was constructed using an innovative, two-pronged approach involving a structured knowledgebase at the back-end, and an intuitive knowledge-sharing interface and user-friendly query engine in front. The knowledgebase was seeded with several patient case reports and information was mined via text-mining and literature review by human curators. Using our novel Wiki-based platform to present and share knowledge stored in the PCM knowledgebase, users are able to suggest corrections, propose additions or point to errors in the knowledgebase. The result is a community-driven evolving knowledgebase holding integrated and consolidated knowledge of markers and indications for personalized cancer medicine. We suggest that the PCM Knowledgebase and Wiki could serve as an important tool for the advancement of clinical trials and care in the field of precision cancer medicine.",

However, the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals is increasing rapidly, accelerated by the meaningful use initiatives associated with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services EHR Incentive Programs. The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting \"alert fatigue\" and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of \"big data\" in health care provide the potential not only to perform \"in silico\" research but also to provide \"real time\" diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. \"On demand\" access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy!

Media coverage predicted a drastic transformation for the practice of medicine, second to the revolution brought about by the discovery of vaccines and antibiotics. From the perspective of another 3 years, during which substantial new insights were made into the enormous complexity of human genome variation, it seems that true personalized medicine may still be decades away for many aspects of medical treatment. Nonetheless, the prospects for implementation of at least certain elements of personalized medicine for one key discipline, psychiatry, might be relatively close and more realistic.

It is unclear if and how such recommendations are developed in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Our aim was to assess if and how CPGs develop risk-stratified treatment recommendations for the prevention or treatment of common chronic diseases. METHODS: We searched the United States National Guideline Clearinghouse for US, Canadian and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (United Kingdom) CPGs for heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes that make risk-stratified treatment recommendations. We included only those CPGs that made risk-stratified treatment recommendations based on risk assessment tools. Two reviewers independently identified CPGs and extracted information on recommended risk assessment tools; type of evidence about treatment benefits and harms; methods for linking risk estimates to treatment evidence and for developing treatment thresholds; and consideration of patient preferences. RESULTS: We identified 20 CPGs that made risk-stratified treatment recommendations out of 133 CPGs that made any type of treatment recommendations for the chronic diseases considered in this study. Of the included 20 CPGs, 16 (80%) used evidence about treatment benefits from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses or other guidelines, and the source of evidence was unclear in the remaining four (20%) CPGs. Nine CPGs (45%) used evidence on harms from randomized controlled trials or observational studies, while 11 CPGs (55%) did not clearly refer to harms. Nine CPGs (45%) explained how risk prediction and evidence about treatments effects were linked (for example, applying estimates of relative risk reductions to absolute risks), but only one CPG (5%) assessed benefit and harm quantitatively and three CPGs (15%) explicitly reported consideration of patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Only a small proportion of CPGs for chronic diseases make risk-stratified treatment recommendations with a focus on heart disease and stroke prevention, diabetes and breast cancer. For most CPGs it is unclear how risk-stratified treatment recommendations were developed. As a consequence, it is uncertain if CPGs support patients and physicians in finding an acceptable benefit- harm balance that reflects both profile-specific outcome risks and preferences.",

The concept of personalized medicine is that the treatment of the disease is designed on the basis of the individual needs of each patient and the factors that influence their response to different drugs. Individualization of patient care has the potential to generate novel effective therapies, limit the adverse drug effects, create optimal treatments for individual patients, and decrease the cost associated with chronic illness and complications of drug usage. However, to achieve the goals of personalized medicine many challenges must be addressed. Here we discuss possible ways to increase the consistency of data generated by basic research and their suitability for application in medicine. New technologies employing systems biology and computer based approaches will facilitate overcoming many of the scientific challenges in the field. Changes in the education of researchers, health professionals, and the public are also required to successfully implement personalized medicine as a routine in the clinic. Finally, shift of the focus away from the development of blockbuster drugs in the biopharmaceutical industry, and modifications in the legal system to accommodate novel advancements need to be considered.

Multiple trials have shown the benefits of treatment with platinum doublets in lung cancer. This \"one treatment fits all\" approach was further refined by the introduction of targeted agents and discovery of subpopulations of patients who benefited from treatment with these agents. It has also become evident that certain histologic subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer respond better to one cytotoxic chemotherapy versus others. This has led to the concept of using histology to guide therapy. With the introduction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the discovery of activating mutations in the EGFR gene, further personalization of treatment for subgroups of patients has become a reality. More recently, the presence of a fusion gene, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 - anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK), was identified as the driver mutation in yet another subgroup of patients, and subsequent studies have led to approval of crizotinib in this group of patients. In this article, efforts in personalizing delivery of care based on the histological subtypes of lung cancer and the role of K-RAS and EGFR mutations, EML4/ALK translocation, and ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing 1) and EGFR expression in choosing appropriate treatments for patients with advanced lung cancer are discussed.

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 382 million individuals worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Over 40 and nearly 80 genetic loci influencing susceptibility to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, have been identified. In addition, there is emerging evidence that some genetic variants help to predict response to treatment. Other variants confer apparent protection from diabetes or its complications and may lead to development of novel treatment approaches. Currently, there is clear clinical utility to genetic testing to find the at least 1% of diabetic individuals who have monogenic diabetes (e.g., maturity-onset diabetes of the young and KATP channel neonatal diabetes). Diagnosing many of these currently underdiagnosed types of diabetes enables personalized treatment, resulting in improved and less invasive glucose control, better prediction of prognosis, and enhanced familial risk assessment. Efforts to enhance the rate of detection, diagnosis, and personalized treatment of individuals with monogenic diabetes should set the stage for effective clinical translation of current genetic, pharmacogenetic, and pharmacogenomic research of more complex forms of diabetes.",

METHODS: In May 2012, we convened a meeting of researchers, clinicians, and consumer advocates to review the state of current knowledge on molecular mechanisms and identify fruitful areas for further investigations. RESULTS: The meeting consisted of 7 scientific sessions ranging from Epidemiology, Early Detection, and Biology to Therapeutics and Quality of Life. Sessions consisted of talks and panel discussions by international leaders in ovarian cancer research. A special career development session by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Academy as well as an oral abstract and poster session showcased promising new research by junior scientists. CONCLUSIONS: Technological advances in the last decade have increased our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in a host of biological activities related to ovarian cancer. Understanding the role these mechanisms play in cancer initiation and progression will help lead to the development of prevention and treatment modalities that can be personalized to each patient, thereby helping to overcome this highly fatal malignancy.",

        "abstract": "A methodology to perform personalized visual biofeedback aimed to the reduction of respiratory amplitude is here proposed. A custom-made software allows to adapt the biofeedback parameters to a patient's respiratory pattern by calculating a limiting range for respiratory amplitude obtained from data acquired during free breathing. The proposed methodology has been tested on ten healthy volunteers and on five lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment. The protocol for volunteers consisted of 3 min of data acquisition during the subject's free breathing, 2 min of visual biofeedback within the limits, and 3 min of free breathing. The patients' free breathing was acquired in 3 min and the visual biofeedback performed during all the sessions of the radiotherapy treatment, i.e., an average of eight sessions and an average total treatment time of 2000 s each patient. All the volunteers and three patients of the five found the protocol comfortable. The settlement time needed for considering the limiting range stabilized during free breathing has been calculated as 120 +/- 10 s (p < 0.05). During visual biofeedback the baseline shift was removed and the average respiratory amplitude was reduced by about 40% for all the subjects. The variability of the breathing amplitude remained unaltered during biofeedback. Eight volunteers and three patients remained within the limiting range for more than 90% of the biofeedback period; all subjects remained within the limiting range for more than 80% of the biofeedback period. During the biofeedback period both groups, volunteers and patients, showed a significant increase in breathing frequency which was mostly doubled. Patients with shallow breathing performed comfortably the biofeedback.",

Shianna, Thomas J. Urban, Erin L. Heinzen, Ping Qiu, Arthur H. Bertelsen, Andrew J. Muir, Mark Sulkowski, John G. McHutchison, David B. Goldstei. Abstract reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature 200;461(7262):399-401. copyright 2009. Abstract: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 170 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of cirrhosis in North America. Although the recommended treatment for chronic infection involves a 48-week course of peginterferon-2b (PegIFN-2b) or -2a (PegIFN-2a) combined with ribavirin (RBV), it is well known that many patients will not be cured by treatment, and that patients of European ancestry have a significantly higher probability of being cured than patients of African ancestry. In addition to limited efficacy, treatment is often poorly tolerated because of side effects that prevent some patients from completing therapy. For these reasons, identification of the determinants of response to treatment is a high priority. Here we report that a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, encoding interferon-3 (IFN-3), is associated with an approximately twofold change in response to treatment, both among patients of European ancestry (P = 1.06 10-25) and African-Americans (P = 2.06 10-30). Because the genotype leading to better response is in substantially greater frequency in European than African populations, this genetic polymorphism also explains approximately half of the difference in response rates between African-Americans and patients of European ancestry. ?? 2010.",

Most clinician respondents currently use family history routinely in their clinical practice, but only 18 percent of clinicians use pharmacogenetics. Only two respondents correctly identified the number of drug package inserts with pharmacogenetic indications. We also found strong support for the return of genetic research results to participants. Our results demonstrate that while Duke healthcare providers are enthusiastic about genomic technologies, use of genomic tools outside of research has been limited. Respondents favor return of research-based genetic results to participants, but clinicians lack knowledge about pharmacogenetic applications.

Most physicians had not heard of, but were willing to use, PGT services and felt comfortable interpreting PGT results. Most physicians were comfortable with technology. Physicians who perceived genotype data to be useful in making prescribing decisions, had more positive attitudes toward adopting genome-guided prescribing through CDS.

Outcomes were monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 1033 patients had been randomized by June 2001. For 69 patients who had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) that was no more than 20 percent of their predicted value and either a homogeneous distribution of emphysema on computed tomography or a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity that was no more than 20 percent of their predicted value, the 30-day mortality rate after surgery was 16 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.2 to 26.7 percent), as compared with a rate of 0 percent among 70 medically treated patients (P<0.001). Among these high-risk patients, the overall mortality rate was higher in surgical patients than medical patients (0.43 deaths per person-year vs. 0.11 deaths per person-year; relative risk, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 9.0). As compared with medically treated patients, survivors of surgery had small improvements at six months in the maximal workload (P= 0.06), the distance walked in six minutes (P=0.03), and FEV1 (P<0.001), but a similar health-related quality of life. The results of the analysis of functional outcomes for all patients, which accounted for deaths and missing data, did not favor either treatment.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Caution is warranted in the use of lung-volume-reduction surgery in patients with emphysema who have a low FEV1 and either homogeneous emphysema or a very low carbon monoxide diffusing capacity.

The added value was determined by the added value on prior probability for each (bio)marker. Only an increase/decrease in chance of response \u2a7e15% was considered clinically relevant, whereas in oncology values >25% are common. RESULTS: Of the 57 eligible studies, 14 (bio)markers were studied in more than one cohort and an overview of the added predictive value of each marker is presented. Of the replicated predictors, none consistently showed an increase/decrease in probability of response \u2a7e15%. However, positivity of RF and ACPA in case of rituximab and the presence of the TNF-\u03b1 promoter 308 GG genotype for TNF inhibitor therapy were consistently predictive, yet low in added predictive value.

However, methylation of the O\u2076-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is the only molecular marker linked to sensitivity of a specific treatment, that is, alkylating agent chemotherapy, and this predictive value may be limited to glioblastoma. Moreover, in the absence of potent alternative drugs, temozolomide chemotherapy should not be withheld from patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without MGMT promoter methylation in general practice. In the context of clinical trials, however, irrespective of whether classical cytotoxic drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents are used, tissue should be centrally collected. Appropriate research programs should seek to define enriched patient populations for future trials and ultimately facilitate individualized cancer treatments.",

        "abstract": "The goal of growth hormone (GH) treatment in a short child is to attain a fast catch-up growth toward the target height (TH) standard deviation score (SDS), followed by a maintenance phase, a proper pubertal height gain, and an adult height close to TH. The short-term response variable of GH treatment, first-year height velocity (HV) (cm/year or change in height SDS), can either be compared with GH response charts for diagnosis, age and gender, or with predicted HV based on prediction models. Three types of prediction models have been described: the Kabi International Growth Hormone Study models, the Gothenburg models and the Cologne model. With these models, 50-80% of the variance could be explained. When used prospectively, individualized dosing reduces the variation in growth response in comparison with a fixed dose per body weight. Insulin-like growth factor-I-based dose titration also led to a decrease in the variation. It is uncertain whether adding biochemical, genetic or proteomic markers may improve the accuracy of the prediction. Prediction models may lead to a more evidence-based approach to determine the GH dose regimen and may reduce the drug costs for GH treatment. There is a need for user-friendly software programs to make prediction models easily available in the clinic.",

An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC carcinogenesis and progression has enabled the identification of many potential HCC biomarkers. In addition to predicting prognosis and recurrence, these markers may guide decisions regarding therapeutic intervention of potential targets and appropriate therapeutic modalities for individual patients. Considering the high recurrence rate associated with HCC resection, improved biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis, predicting recurrence, and monitoring progression are urgently needed in clinical practice. \\n\\nSTUDY SECTION AND RESULTS\\nThis systematic review examines evidence from published studies that have reported emerging prognostic biomarkers, paying particular attention to markers evaluated by histopathological analysis of resected HCC tissues. These markers include molecules involved in cellular proliferation and survival (e.g. cyclins and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, mutant p53, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor [c-MET]), aberrantly expressed cell surface proteins (e.g. glypican 3, monocarboxylate transporter 4, and hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1), and factors found in altered tumor microenvironments (e.g. angiogenesis factors, regulatory T-cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells). \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nIdentification of novel, effective biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC is critical for the improvement of companion diagnostics in personalized oncology therapies for HCC. The molecules described in this review are attractive candidates for future HCC biomarkers to be used in clinical oncology practice.",

This would require the inclusion of genetic testing as an integral part of individual risk assessment of an asymptomatic individual. Front line health professionals would be expected to interact with and assist asymptomatic individuals through the risk stratification process. In that case, additional knowledge and skills may be needed. Current guidelines and frameworks for genetic competencies of non-specialist health professionals place an emphasis on rare inherited genetic diseases. For common diseases, health professionals do use risk assessment tools but such tools currently do not assess genetic susceptibility of individuals. In this article, we compare the skills and knowledge needed by non-genetic health professionals, if risk-stratified prevention is implemented, with existing competence recommendations from the UK, USA and Europe, in order to assess the gaps in current competences. We found that health professionals would benefit from understanding the contribution of common genetic variations in disease risk, the rationale for a risk-stratified prevention pathway, and the implications of using genomic information in risk-assessment and risk management of asymptomatic individuals for common disease prevention.",

Recognizing that the diffusion of diagnostic tests is a conditio sine qua non for the success of personalized lung cancer therapies, this study analyzed the diffusion of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tests in Germany. Qualitative and quantitative research strategies were combined in a mixed-method design. A literature review and subsequent Key Opinion Leader interviews identified a set of qualitative factors driving the diffusion process, which were then translated into an online survey. The survey was conducted among a sample of 961 oncologists (11.34% response rate). The responses were analyzed in a multiple linear regression which identified six statistically significant factors driving the diffusion of molecular diagnostic lung cancer tests: reimbursement, attitude towards R&amp;D, information self-assessment, perceived attitudes of colleagues, age and test-pathway strategies. Besides the important role of adequate reimbursement and relevant guidelines, the results of this study suggest that an increasing usage of test-pathway strategies, especially in an office-based setting, can increase the diffusion of molecular diagnostic lung cancer tests in the future.",

        "abstract": "The advent of sophisticated experimental tools that can probe the molecular pathology of cancer has revealed a number of genes and gene families that could prove attractive targets for cancer therapy. Thus, gene silencing strategies have been envisioned to treat cancer by targeting the cancer cell's capacity to: (I) resist conventional treatment methods (chemotherapy and radiotherapy), (II) promote angiogenesis, and (III) metastasize and/or to survive microenvironments that normally would promote cell apoptosis/necrosis. The realization of such strategies is limited by the lack of pharmaceutically-viable technologies that enable the safe and effective delivery of gene-targeting agents to neoplastic cells following systemic administration. There are many reasons for this, including an incomplete understanding of how cancer cells respond when genes are silenced. Further the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic attributes of gene therapy products are not well understood. This review will discuss gene therapy strategies that have been developed based on gene inhibition by the use of antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and RNA interference (RNAi). In this context, several particularly promising targets will be described, with a focus on strategies that have progressed to the stage where clinical trials have been initiated. The review highlights product development strategies that emphasize non-viral systemic formulations and the potential for delivery systems to become an enabling technology for development of effective gene therapy products.",

In phase III trials, regorafenib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in patients with metastatic CRC progressing after all available standard therapies, and significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with advanced GIST in whom at least imatinib and sunitinib had failed. Thus, this agent holds promise as a new standard of care for CRC and GIST patients after disease progression following all other approved therapies. The clinical trials reported to date show that this new treatment has a consistent adverse event profile that is quite different from that of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies. The most common adverse events of regorafenib include dermatologic and mucosal toxicities (especially hand-foot skin reaction, rash, and oral mucositis), constitutional symptoms (e.g., fatigue, nausea, and weight loss), vascular effects (especially hypertension), and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 lowers blood homocysteine concentrations by about 25% to 30% in populations without routine folic acid fortification of food and by about 10% to 15% in populations with such fortification. In observational studies, 25% lower homocysteine has been associated with about 10% less coronary heart disease (CHD) and about 20% less stroke. METHODS: We reviewed the design and statistical power of 12 randomized trials assessing the effects of lowering homocysteine with B-vitamin supplements on risk of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Seven of these trials are being conducted in populations without fortification (5 involving participants with prior CHD and 2 with prior stroke) and 5 in populations with fortification (2 with prior CHD, 2 with renal disease, and 1 with prior stroke). These trials may not involve sufficient number of vascular events or last long enough to have a good chance on their own to detect reliably plausible effects of homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular risk. But, taken together, these 12 trials involve about 52,000 participants: 32,000 with prior vascular disease in unfortified populations and 14,000 with vascular disease and 6000 with renal disease in fortified populations. Hence, a combined analysis of these trials should have adequate power to determine whether lowering homocysteine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events within just a few years. CONCLUSION: The strength of association of homocysteine with risk of cardiovascular disease may be weaker than had previously been believed. Extending the duration of treatment in these trials would allow any effects associated with prolonged differences in homocysteine concentrations to emerge. Establishing a prospective meta-analysis of the ongoing trials of homocysteine lowering should ensure that reliable information emerges about the effects of such interventions on cardiovascular disease outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Companion diagnostics are an indispensable part of personalized medicine and will likely continue to rapidly increase in number and application to disease areas. The first companion diagnostics were launched in the 1980s and in the face of significant initial skepticism from drug developers as to whether segmenting a drug's market through a diagnostic was advisable. The commercial success of drugs such as Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab) and Gleevec\u00ae (imatinib), which both require testing with companion diagnostics before they can be prescribed, has moved the entire companion diagnostic field forward. From an initial start of a handful of oncology drugs with corresponding diagnostics, the field has expanded to include multiple therapeutic areas, and the number of combinations has grown by 12-fold. Based on drugs in clinical trials, the rapid growth will likely continue for the foreseeable future. This expansion of companion diagnostics will also have a global component as markets in Europe will evolve in a similar but not identical pattern as the US. One of the greatest challenges to future growth in companion diagnostics is aligning the incentives of all stakeholders. A major driver of growth will continue to be the economic incentives for drug developers to pair their products with diagnostics. However, diagnostic companies are caught between the conflicting demands of two major stakeholders, pharmaceutical companies on one hand and payers/providers on the other. Regulators are also becoming more demanding in aligning development time lines between drugs and diagnostics. In order to survive and prosper, diagnostic companies will need to think more broadly about companion diagnostics than the historical match between a specific drug and a single diagnostic. They will also have to continue the process of consolidation and global expansion that the industry has already begun. Despite these potential obstacles, companion diagnostics have become one of the hottest areas of deal making in the diagnostic space in recent years, and the future trends continue to look bright.",

PI3K/mTOR pathway drugs are active in endocrine and trastuzumab-resistant disease. Drugs targeted at PI3K/mTOR, FGFR, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase show early signs of efficacy in MBC subpopulations enriched with relevant pathway aberrancies. Regimens combining targeted agents with either endocrine, anti-HER2, or chemotherapy treatments are also being studied in hormone receptor-defined and HER2-defined or pathway-enriched subgroups.\\n\\nSUMMARY: A new approach to personalized medicine for MBC that involves molecular screening for clinically relevant genomic alterations and genotype-targeted treatments is emerging.

It includes details of the directions in which the balloons drifted from North Stamford, the distances covered, the rates of drifting and the effect of local conditions on the air currents. It is pointed out that such drift might carry the beetles long distances from an infected area, and that the effect on the drifting individuals of downward currents near expanses of water would favour the occurrence of the disease. The distribution of the balloons agreed in some cases with that of infected elm trees. life-history of Phytomyza ilicicola, Lw., on holly [Ilex]. The eggs are laid in the developing leaves, and the larvae mine in the upper surface of the new foliage throughout most of the season; the pupae overwinter in the mines, and the adults emerge over a period of 10-14 days, beginning about mid-May. The results of laboratory tests with sprays containing nicotine sulfate or lead arsenate have already been noticed [26 546]. In field tests in 1937, a spray containing 2 U.S. gals, summer Volck oil, I U.S. pint nicotine sulfate, and 1 Ib. lead arsenate in 100 U.S. gals., applied in May when large numbers of adults were emerging from the leaves, gave excellent control. [Cornus], reported by Felt and Bromley (pp. 30-33), confirmed that Mycodiplosis alternata, Felt, is the causal agent [cf. 26 546], since over 2, 000 galls, kept over winter in cages with sterile soil, gave rise to this Cecidomyiid, and no examples of Porricondyla sp. were obtained. When some of the adults were transferred to outdoor cages containing growing dogwood tips, club galls developed later in the year. The eggs are laid near the tips of the young growth, and the infested shoots begin to swell in the second half of June, when the second set of leaves is developing. The galls contain 1-6 larvae, which drop to the ground when full-grown and overwinter in the soil. The adults emerge towards the end of May, but are rarely seen on the plants. Applications of sprays containing 4 Ib. resin residue emulsion and 4 Ib. cube powder per 100 U.S. gals, on 14th, 18th and 28th May and 14th June appeared to be effective, since a badly infested tree had no new galls by 7th July and only eight by 10th October. chittendeni, Laing, and Giardomyia rhododendri, Felt, on rhododendron. Immature Aleurodids are not easily killed by insecticides, but it has been reported that a 2 per cent, summer oil, applied in early autumn or in spring to the underside of the leaves, has given satisfactory control of D. chittendeni [cf. also 25 242]. This spray with the addition of nicotine will kill the adults; the nicotine should, therefore, be added to any sprays applied between May and August. The most promising treatment against G. rhododendri, which occurs in south-eastern New York and south-western New England [cf. 27 499] but has caused only local injury, is a spray of 1/2 U.S. pint nicotine, 3 Ib. soap and 9 U.S. gals, molasses in 40 U.S. gals, water, applied to the tips of the plants just after new growth starts in spring or midsummer. 36-39) includes notes on the bionomics of Cinara (Lachnus) sabinae, Gill. & Palm., which caused considerable injury to ornamental red cedars (Juniperus virginiana) in the north-eastern United States in 1928 and 1929 and has caused noticeable damage in most years since [cf. 22 530]. Its colonies were abundant on red cedars at North Stamford in late May, June and early July; alate migratory forms then appeared and left the trees, which became almost free from infestation, but had browned foliage and dying shoots early in August. What were probably overwintering eggs of this Aphid ccurred on the tips of shoots of infested trees in November. C. sirobi, Fitch, is commonly found on white pine (Pinus strobus) throughout the season. The conspicuous overwintering eggs hatch as early as mid-April near Stamford, and the Aphids feed on the smooth bark of the twigs and smaller branches in colonies ranging from a few individuals to some hundreds. The population is usually small during the hot weather, but large numbers may develop during September and persist into November, and many trees, particularly the younger ones, do not survive the winter after a heavy autumn infestation. Certain pines, such as P. mugo, P. densiflora, P. nigra and P. sylvestris, may be seriously injured by Eulachnus agilis, Kalt., which has also been recorded on P. halepensis and P. pinaster. This species was erroneously identified as E. rileyi, Williams, in earlier work in which it was recorded as a pest of P. mugo [24 531, 715], but further observations have shown that the true E. rileyi, which is common on the needles of red pine [P. resinosa], is relatively innocuous, no serious injury due to it having been found on this pine over a period of several years. The Japanese table pine (P. densifloraumbraculifera) is badly injured and sometimes killed by Aphids, and colonies of C. pini, L., which has also been recorded from P. sylvestris, have been observed in autumn on the twigs and branches of trees that were found to be badly injured in the following spring. A similar and possibly identical species has been found in autumn on the bark of the twigs and branches of the Japanese black pine (P. thunbergi). The overwintering eggs were deposited on the needles, and light infestations were noted in the following spring. Though growth was retarded, severe injury, such as occurred on the table pine, was not observed. C. pinicola, Kalt. (hyalina, Koch) is sometimes abundant on the undersides of the twigs of young Norway spruce (Picea abies], usually near the tips. No damage due to its feeding has been observed, but it produces honey-dew that attracts ants, wasps, and flies. Thorough applications of a contact insecticide when the Aphids are present, but not yet injurious, usually during June against the summer infestation and during September against the autumn one, are recommended for the control of all these species. with wetting agents for lead arsenate (pp. 40-42) and of work with colloidal lead arsenates (pp. 42-43) was also contained in a paper already noticed [29 118]. At the rate of 1/2 Ib. per 100 U.S. gals., colloidal lead arsenate caused some reduction in the feeding of the European willow leaf-beetle [Plagiodera versicolora, Laich.], and at the rate of 3 Ib. per 100 U.S. gals., it gave results similar to those obtained with standard lead arsenate at the same rate.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed for the identification of genetic variants within germline DNA that can explain a significant portion of the genetic underpinnings of prostate cancer. Despite evidence suggesting that these genetic variants can be used for improved risk stratification, they have not yet been routinely incorporated into routine clinical practice. This review highlights their potential utility in prostate cancer screening. RECENT FINDINGS There are now almost 100 genetic variants, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been recently found to be associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer. In addition, some of these prostate cancer risk SNPs have also been found to influence prostate specific antigen (PSA) expression levels and potentially aggressive disease. SUMMARY Incorporation of panels of prostate cancer risk SNPs into clinical practice offers potential to provide improvements in patient selection for prostate cancer screening; PSA interpretation (e.g. by correcting for the presence of SNPs that influence PSA expression levels; decision for biopsy (using prostate cancer risk SNPs); and possibly the decision for treatment. A proposed clinical algorithm incorporating these prostate cancer risk SNPs is discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether statin therapy is as effective in women as in men is debated, especially for primary prevention. We undertook a meta-analysis of statin trials in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration database to compare the effects of statin therapy between women and men. METHODS: We performed meta-analyses on data from 22 trials of statin therapy versus control (n=134 537) and five trials of more-intensive versus less-intensive statin therapy (n=39 612). Effects on major vascular events, major coronary events, stroke, coronary revascularisation and mortality were weighted per 1\u00b70 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol and effects in men and women compared with a Cox model that adjusted for non-sex differences. For subgroup analyses, we used 99% CIs to make allowance for the multiplicity of comparisons. FINDINGS: 46 675 (27%) of 174 149 randomly assigned participants were women. Allocation to a statin had similar absolute effects on 1 year lipid concentrations in both men and women (LDL cholesterol reduced by about 1\u00b71 mmol/L in statin vs control trials and roughly 0\u00b75 mmol/L for more-intensive vs less-intensive therapy). Women were generally at lower cardiovascular risk than were men in these trials. The proportional reductions per 1\u00b70 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in major vascular events were similar overall for women (rate ratio [RR] 0\u00b784, 99% CI 0\u00b778-0\u00b791) and men (RR 0\u00b778, 99% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b781, adjusted p value for heterogeneity by sex=0\u00b733) and also for those women and men at less than 10% predicted 5 year absolute cardiovascular risk (adjusted heterogeneity p=0\u00b711). Likewise, the proportional reductions in major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke did not differ significantly by sex. No adverse effect on rates of cancer incidence or non-cardiovascular mortality was noted for either sex. These net benefits translated into all-cause mortality reductions with statin therapy for both women (RR 0\u00b791, 99% CI 0\u00b784-0\u00b799) and men (RR 0\u00b790, 99% CI 0\u00b786-0\u00b795; adjusted heterogeneity p=0\u00b743). INTERPRETATION: In men and women at an equivalent risk of cardiovascular disease, statin therapy is of similar effectiveness for the prevention of major vascular events.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common type of cancer in the Western world. The treatment of this disease has evolved greatly, particularly for patients with metastatic disease. The advent of combination chemotherapy plus targeted agents has led to more curative resections and improved survival rates in these patients. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis has facilitated tumor characterization, prognosis and patient stratification, bringing us one step closer towards personalized medicine.\\n\\nSUMMARY: There are two main pathways of CRC development: (1) chromosomal instability, also known as the classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence, and (2) microsatellite instability, caused by a defective mismatch repair (dMMR) system. Analysis of these pathways has uncovered key prognostic and predictive biomarkers to guide patient selection and treatment strategy. This review summarizes the current treatment regimens and recent advances in the personalized therapy of CRC.\\n\\nKEY MESSAGE: Understanding of the mechanisms of CRC pathogenesis has led to new developments in tumor characterization, patient stratification, prognosis and treatment, bringing us closer to personalized therapy.\\n\\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: In the adjuvant setting, the treatment decision is driven by clinical and histopathological factors. dMMR status is one of the most robust positive prognostic factors in resected colon cancer. More and more guidelines recommend refraining from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with dMMR. In the metastatic setting, the introduction of effective compounds, including agents that target the epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways, has significantly improved survival. The presence of wild-type KRAS and NRAS (all RAS) is a positive predictive factor for epidermal growth factor receptor antibody treatment. Therefore, analysis of all RAS status is recommended for all patients with metastatic disease prior to the initiation of first-line chemotherapy.",

Nevertheless, desperate views have changed to substantial optimism over recent years, as several lines of evidence have indicated that disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) have beneficial effects on neurological deterioration in MS. However, assessing the success of DMD therapy in an individual patient may not always be clear-cut for the doctor. In order to address this issue, an International Working Group of doctors experienced in treating patients with MS convened to discuss the optimization of DMD therapy, and the outcome of this consensus meeting is reported here. Participants developed statements that classify changes in relapses, disease progression and brain magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with MS who is taking DMD therapy, according to whether they are worthy of note, of some concern, or of serious concern and requiring a reassessment of current therapy. Based on these statements, the performance of standardized examinations to document changes in the disease enables a visual measure of the progress of an individual patient to be built up on an analogue model. This model provides a useful framework to help the neurologist to identify those patients for whom the therapeutic options should be reconsidered.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease involving many different genomic and epigenomic changes, mutations, copy number changes, loss of heterozygosity etc. These differences cause tumors with the same pathological classification to respond very differently to the drugs, making therapy decisions difficult. As a result of intensive research in the field of oncology much information is available on molecular interactions and pathways involved in cancer onset and progression. In addition recent increases in the capacity of next-generation sequencing systems will provide huge amounts of genome, epigenome and transcriptome data, making it feasible to apply deep sequencing in the clinic to characterize tumor/patient samples. Both, the complexity of disturbances in interaction networks of biological processes in cancer and the new molecular information generated by this sequence analysis urgently require the development of systems that are able to derive clinically relevant predictions from all available data. The \u201d Virtual Patient\u201d modeling system combines general information available about cancer relevant pathways with the individual (genome, transcriptome) information available on the individual tumor/patient to generate models able to predict the effects and side effects of individual drugs or drug combinations. This opens the way to experiment with the response of the model of the individual patient to different therapy options in the computer, offering new routes to improve oncological practice, reduce health costs but also to accelerate the development and the approval process for new drugs in this area.",

This meta-analysis included individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control (n=134?537; mean LDL cholesterol difference 1\u00b708 mmol/L; median follow-up 4\u00b78 years) and five trials of more versus less statin (n=39?612; difference 0\u00b751 mmol/L; 5\u00b71 years). Major vascular events were major coronary events (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death), strokes, or coronary revascularisations. Participants were separated into five categories of baseline 5-year major vascular event risk on control therapy (no statin or low-intensity statin) (&lt;5%, ?5% to &lt;10%, ?10% to &lt;20%, ?20% to &lt;30%, ?30%); in each, the rate ratio (RR) per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction was estimated. Reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events (RR 0\u00b779, 95% CI 0\u00b777?0\u00b781, per 1\u00b70 mmol/L reduction), largely irrespective of age, sex, baseline LDL cholesterol or previous vascular disease, and of vascular and all-cause mortality. The proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0\u00b762 [99% CI 0\u00b747?0\u00b781], 0\u00b769 [99% CI 0\u00b760?0\u00b779], 0\u00b779 [99% CI 0\u00b774?0\u00b785], 0\u00b781 [99% CI 0\u00b777?0\u00b786], and 0\u00b779 [99% CI 0\u00b774?0\u00b784]; trend p=0\u00b704), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events (RR 0\u00b757, 99% CI 0\u00b736?0\u00b789, p=0\u00b70012, and 0\u00b761, 99% CI 0\u00b750?0\u00b774, p&lt;0\u00b70001) and in coronary revascularisations (RR 0\u00b752, 99% CI 0\u00b735?0\u00b775, and 0\u00b763, 99% CI 0\u00b751?0\u00b779; both p&lt;0\u00b70001). For stroke, the reduction in risk in participants with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10% (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0\u00b776, 99% CI 0\u00b761?0\u00b795, p=0\u00b70012) was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories (trend p=0\u00b73). In participants without a history of vascular disease, statins reduced the risks of vascular (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0\u00b785, 95% CI 0\u00b777?0\u00b795) and all-cause mortality (RR 0\u00b791, 95% CI 0\u00b785?0\u00b797), and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline risk. There was no evidence that reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin increased cancer incidence (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 1\u00b700, 95% CI 0\u00b796?1\u00b704), cancer mortality (RR 0\u00b799, 95% CI 0\u00b793?1\u00b706), or other non-vascular mortality. In individuals with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10%, each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 years. This benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of statin therapy. Under present guidelines, such individuals would not typically be regarded as suitable for LDL-lowering statin therapy. The present report suggests, therefore, that these guidelines might need to be reconsidered.

In this article, we reviewed the current literature to present our conceptual model of the conscious auditory percept and tinnitus - based on experimental research - in order to explain the clinical approach to the individual tinnitus patient. RECENT FINDINGS: Fundamental research has provided evidence to support the neurophysiological model of tinnitus developed by Jastreboff. By manipulating the limbic, autonomic and auditory systems, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) aims to reduce the response to the abnormal stimulus. Evidence has confirmed the effectiveness of TRT and cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing the negative impact of subjective tinnitus on the patients' quality of life. SUMMARY: Every patient with subjective tinnitus has its unique 'tinnitus profile' which provides a guide to the necessary combination of therapeutic actions. Evidence suggests the multidisciplinary approach combining etiological therapy as well as TRT, and cognitive behavioral therapy in specialized clinics is not only effective in reducing the patient's quality of life but also cost-effective from a healthcare and societal point of view.",

        "abstract": "Background: There is growing interest in the molecular-genomic characterization of metastatic tumor sites to aid prognostic determination and to guide the development of targeted therapies. The importance of this effort is partly based on the predictive value of certain mutations to identify patients likely to respond to specific therapies. Examples include mutations in KRAS & BRAF (cetuximab or panitumumab resistance), FBXW7 (anti-tubulin resistance), GNAS (MEK or ERK inhibitor trials) and PIK3CA (PI3K and mTOR inhibitor trials). It is anticipated that customized genotyping by screening for driver mutations will become standard of care. Our group previously demonstrated the feasibility of targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for simultaneous sequencing and detection of multiple mutations from archived EUS FNA cytology specimens. Malignant lymph nodes (LN) have the greatest impact on the prognosis of locally advanced rectal cancer. Aims: In patients with treatment na\u00efve locally advanced rectal cancer to determine: 1.) the frequency of pathogenic alterations within EUS FNA cytology specimens from malignant lymph nodes, and 2.) the presence of one or more alterations associated with existing or experimental targeted therapies. Methods: DNA extraction from 131 of 231 (57%) screened archived malignant LN cytology slides from 2002-2010, yielded suitable quantity and quality [55 ng/ul (range 0-333)] for NGS in 127 (97%) patients. The Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 V2 Cancer Hotspot NGS Cancer Panel and MiSeq sequencers were used to simultaneously sequence and assess for \u2265 2,500 possible mutations in 50 key cancer genes. Results: Complete sequencing was achieved in 102 patients' whereby191 pathogenic alterations were identified in 19 genes. Genotyping revealed mutations in TP53 (35 %), APC (22 %), KRAS (17 %), FBXW7 (5%), PIK3CA (4 %), BRAF (3 %), SMAD4 (3%) and GNAS (1 %). Of note, 44/102 (43%) LN's harbored at least one pathogenic alteration that has been linked to a clinical treatment option or is currently being investigated in new targeted therapy clinical trials. Conclusion: Genomic alterations that are directly linked to a possible patient and tumor specific therapeutic option were identified in 43% of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Our data demonstrate the successful ability to apply a single multiplex test to allow multi-gene mutation detection from EUS FNA cytology specimen DNA that until now were regarded as insufficient to perform NGS. The application of NGS to routine EUS FNA cytology offers tremendous promise for patients by offering personalized care with patient and tumor specific target therapies.",

Up to 40% of 3 million breast cancer survivors in the US will develop BCRL, which has no cure, is irreversible, and requires self-management with regimens that may include multiple components. The complexities of treatment can negatively affect adherence to BCRL self-management which is critical to preventing progressive swelling and infection. The aim of this review of contemporary literature published from 2005-2015 is to examine the complexities of BCRL self-management, to identify adherence-focused studies relevant to BCRL, and to summarize barriers to self-management of BCRL. Six electronic indices were searched from which 120 articles were retrieved; 17 were BCRL-focused; and eight met inclusion criteria. Seventeen of 120 articles identified barriers to self-management of BCRL such as complexities of treatment regimens, symptom burden, balance of time for treatment and life demands, and lack of education and support; however, only eight studies included outcome measures of adherence to BCRL treatment regimens with a subsequent improvement in reduced limb volumes and/or perceptions of self-efficacy and self-regulation. A major limitation is the few number of rigorously developed outcome measures of BCRL adherence. In addition, randomized studies are needed with larger sample sizes to establish adequate levels of evidence for establishing best practice standards for improving adherence to BCRL self-management treatment regimens.",

Such surgical treatments, which include liposuction and plastic surgery of the abdominal wall, are contour plasty or partial-slimming techniques, and are not intended for the purpose of weight loss. For reduction of body weight and visceral fat as well as relief from lifestyle-related diseases, this article describes the application of ortho-molecular medicine techniques that center on the use of mineral fasting. During this treatment, mineral fasting and nutrition therapy are conducted while monitoring of nutritional status and body tissue analysis based on blood biochemical testing is periodically performed. During the slimming therapy described here, metabolism becomes hypercatabolized, allowing partial slimming by mesotherapy to become very effective. By applying this slimming therapy in conjunction with surgical therapy, weight loss treatment can be administered with less risk by reducing the necessity to conduct unnecessary liposuction and plastic surgery of the abdominal wall.",

We considered the benefits provided by genomic testing in context of the concept of personalized medicine. Materials and Methods: We evaluated current and potential uses of genomic testing in health care, using prostate cancer as an example, and considered their implications for individualizing or otherwise improving health care. Results and Conclusions: Personalized medicine is most accurately seen as a comprehensive effort to tailor health care to the individual, spanning multiple dimensions. While genomic tests will offer many potential opportunities to improve the delivery of care, including the potential for genomic research to offer opportunities to improve prostate cancer screening and treatment, such advances do not in themselves constitute a paradigm shift in the delivery of health care. Rather, personalized medicine is based on a partnership between clinician and patient that utilizes shared decision making to determine the best health care options among the available choices, weighing the patient's personal values and preferences together with clinical findings. This approach is particularly important for difficult clinical decisions involving uncertainty and trade-offs, such as those involved in prostate cancer screening and management. The delivery of personalized medicine also requires adequate health care access and assurance that basic health needs have been met. Substantial research investment will be needed to identify how genomic tests can contribute to this effort. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Pharmacogenomics presents an opportunity for rapid translation of associated genetic polymorphisms into diagnostic measures or tests to guide therapy as part of a move towards personalized medicine. Expansion in genotyping technology has cleared the way for widespread use of whole-genome genotyping in the effort to identify novel biology and new genetic markers associated with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints. With new technology and methodology regularly becoming available for use in genetic studies, a discussion on the application of such tools becomes necessary. In particular, quality control criteria have evolved with the use of GWAS as we have come to understand potential systematic errors which can be introduced into the data during genotyping. There have been several replicated pharmacogenomic associations, some of which have moved to the clinic to enact change in treatment decisions. These examples of translation illustrate the strength of evidence necessary to successfully and effectively translate a genetic discovery. In this review, the design of pharmacogenomic association studies is examined with the goal of optimizing the impact and utility of this research.

The prevalence of persistent, unresolved symptoms and their contribution to patient functioning and disease progression emphasize the importance of finding the right treatment choice at the onset and the utility of switching medications based on suboptimal responses. Our primary goal as clinicians is to improve patient function and quality of life. In fact, feelings of well-being and the return to premorbid levels of functioning are frequently rated by patients as being more important than symptom relief. However, functional improvements often lag behind resolution of mood, attributed in large part to persistent and functionally impairing symptoms - namely, fatigue, sleep/wake disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Thus, patient outcomes can be optimized by deconstructing each patient's depressive profile to its component symptoms and specifically targeting those domains that differentially limit patient function.

Since then, several studies have highlighted the complicated aspects of this viral infection in relation to its worldwide prevalence, its clinical presentation, and its therapeutic response. Recently, two landmark scientific breakthroughs have moved us closer to the successful eradication of chronic HCV infection. First, response rates in treatment-naive patients and in prior non-responders to pegylated-interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy are increasing as a direct consequence of the development of direct-acting antiviral drugs. Secondly, the discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms near the interleukin 28B gene significantly related to spontaneous and treatment-induced HCV clearance represents a milestone in the HCV therapeutic landscape. The implementation of this pharmacogenomics finding as a routine test for HCV-infected patients has enhanced our understanding of viral pathogenesis, has encouraged the design of ground-breaking antiviral treatment regimens, and has become useful for pretreatment decision making. Nowadays, interleukin 28B genotyping is considered to be a key diagnostic tool for the management of HCV-infected patients and will maintain its significance for new combination treatment schemes using direct-acting antiviral agents and even in interferon-free regimens. Such pharmacogenomics insights represent a challenge to clinicians, researchers, and health administrators to transform this information into knowledge with the aim of elaborating safer and more effective therapeutic strategies specifically designed for each patient. In conclusion, the individualization of treatment regimens for patients with hepatitis C, that may lead to a universal cure in future years, is becoming a reality due to recent developments in biomarker and genomic medicine. In light of these advances, we review the scientific evidence and clinical implications of recent findings related to host genetic factors in the management of HCV infection.",

ABCB1 SNPs and haplotypes have been suggested to influence the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcome of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, used for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, no consensus has yet been reached with respect to the significance of variant ABCB1 in CML treatment. Functional studies of variant ABCB1 transport of imatinib as well as other TKIs might aid the interpretation of results from in vivo association studies, but are currently lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of ABCB1 variant haplotypes for transport and efficacy of TKIs (imatinib, its major metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib [CGP74588], dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) in CML cells. Variant haplotypes - including the 61A>G, 1199G>A, 1236C>T, 1795G>A, 2677G>T/A, and 3435T>C SNPs - were constructed in ABCB1 complementary DNA and transduced to K562 cells using retroviral gene transfer. The ability of variant cells to express ABCB1 protein and protect against TKI cytotoxicity was investigated. It was found that dasatinib and the imatinib metabolite CGP74588 are effectively transported by ABCB1, while imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are comparatively weaker ABCB1 substrates. None of the investigated haplotypes altered the protective effect of ABCB1 expression against TKI cytotoxicity. These findings imply that the ABCB1 haplotypes investigated here are not likely to influence TKI pharmacokinetics or therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",

Stratified medicines have created clinical success and provided rapid product approvals, particularly in oncology, and indeed have changed the dynamic between drug and diagnostic developers. The commercial payback for such partnerships offered by stratified medicines has been less well articulated, but this has shifted as the benefits in risk management, pricing and value creation for all stakeholders become clearer. In this larger healthcare setting, stratified medicine provides both physicians and patients with greater insight on the disease and provides rationale for providers to understand cost-effectiveness of treatment.

After leukapheresis, DCs were generated from CD14+ monocytes by 6 day cultivation with GM-CSF and IL-4. DCs were then matured by OK-432 treatment and pulsed with cancer-associated antigens, such as WT1, MUC1, and HER2. DCs were administered 5\u20138 times intradermally at 14-day intervals. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nTwenty-six patients with performance status (PS) of 0 (n\u00a0=\u00a04), 1 (n\u00a0=\u00a014), 2 (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and 3 (n\u00a0=\u00a04), and a median age of 55.5 years were eligible for this study. Of the 26 patients, DC vaccine was administered in combination with chemotherapy in 50%. Best response by RECIST, 1 patient showed a complete response (CR), 14 had partial response (PR), and 17 had stable disease (SD). The response ratio was 15.4\uff05.

A thorough evaluation of the underlying cause of syncope is warranted in all patients to precisely diagnose the underlying mechanism or cause in order to provide the appropriate treatment of syncope since it is challenging for many reasons. The purpose of this review on syncope is to provide a thorough differential diagnosis as to the underlying cardiac and non-cardiac causes with methods of assessment of the specific causes. Knowledge of the specific cause, especially in the setting of structural heart disease or primary electrical cardiac disease, has an increased incidence of sudden death and overall mortality. It is also important to establish whether or not syncope is due to orthostatic hypotension since it is associated with a twofold increased mortality, whereas those individuals with neurally mediated syncope have an excellent prognosis",

After examination of the skin pattern in the back, a needle was inserted 2\u20133\u00a0mm deep into the dermal tissue. Fibrous tissue stimulation therapy (FTST) was then administered by stimulation of a hard dermal strand (DS) felt at the tip of the needle. Hundred and five patients were enrolled\u20142 patients, not treated with FTST; 46 and 3, with stages IV and III malignant disease, respectively; and 55, with non-malignant chronic diseases not responding to medical treatment. Among those with malignant disease, 45% showed improvement. The 2 patients who could not be administered FTST because DS could not be identified died soon. Further, the percentage of patients with chronic disease who showed improvement was 88%. The therapy was not entirely effective for patients with degeneration. After FTST, reductions were noted in the sizes of the primary tumor and metastatic tumor. This study illustrates a novel therapeutic technique for treating cancer and chronic diseases. Moreover, FTST has thrown light on a novel biomedical mechanism involving the propagation of systemic signal transduction through fibrotic tissues.",

A total of 1,051 Thai patients participated in this study. Genotypes for CYP2C19 polymorphisms were detected by the microarray-based technique. Furthermore, results of genotyping and platelet aggregation in 96 cardiovascular disease patients on 75 mg clopidogrel maintenance daily dose therapy also were analyzed. Among 1,051 samples, the allele frequencies of CYP2C19 *1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*2, *2/*3, and *1/*17 were found in 428 (40.72%), 369 (35.10%), 72 (6.85%), 77 (7.32%), 59 (5.61%), and 45 (4.30%) of the patients, respectively. Homozygous CYP2C19 *3/*3 was found in one patient (0.10%). Therefore, 40.72% of the patients were predicted as extensive metabolizers, 41.95% as intermediate metabolizers, 13.03% as poor metabolizers, and 4.30% as ultra-rapid metabolizers. Among 96 patients, the frequency of poor metabolizers was significantly higher in the clopidogrel non-responder group than in the responder group (36.0% and 15.5%, respectively, P = 0.03). CYP2C19*1/*17 was observed in responders (n = 2; 2.8%). As a result, CYP2C19 variants were associated with clopidogrel non-responders. However, there is a need for further elucidation of the clinical importance and use of this finding to make firm and cost-effective recommendations for drug treatment in the future.",

They have found that H. erinaceum exerts important bioactivities, including the induction of nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, the inhibition of the cytotoxicity of beta-amyloid peptide, and the protection against neuronal cell death caused by oxidative or endoplasmic reticulum stress. Since NGF was first discovered in the 1940s, it has garnered attention as a substance in the brain that curbs the degeneration and loss of neurons and that promotes the repair and regeneration of nerve function. However, NGF cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier. Amysenone (Amyloban3399, which contains a standardized extract of H. erinaceum) has been found to pass through the blood-brain barrier, and its safety as a health food is currently being ascertained. On the basis of the author's first-hand experiences, Amyloban3399 was found to clearly increase alertness. The actions of Amyloban3399 in treating sleep-related breathing disorders were examined. Amyloban3399 was effective in improving sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome.

Mobile phones and landline phones are key information and communication technologies (ICTs). This research study uses the \"ICTs for healthcare development\" model to ascertain benefits and barriers to the successful implementation of the Childbirth Emergency Phone. PNG has a very high maternal mortality rate. The \"three stages of delay\" typology was developed by Thaddeus and Maine to determine factors that might delay provision of appropriate medical treatment and hence increase risk of maternal death. The \"three stages of delay\" typology has been utilised in various developing countries and also in the present study. Research undertaken has involved semi-structured interviews with health workers, both in rural settings and in the labour ward in Alotau. Additional data has been gathered through focus groups with health workers, analysis of notes made during phone calls, interviews with women and community leaders, observations and field visits. One hundred percent of interviewees (n = 42) said the project helped to solve communication barriers between rural health workers and Alotau Provincial Hospital. Specific examples in which the phone line has helped to create positive health outcomes will be outlined in the paper, drawn from research interviews. The Childbirth Emergency Phone project has shown itself to play a critical role in enabling healthcare workers to address life-threatening childbirth complications. The project shows potential for rollout across PNG; potentially reducing maternal morbidity and maternal mortality rates by overcoming communication challenges.",

The two stresses are common factors in a variety of disorders, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. In addition, the two stresses occur in succession under ischemia-reperfusion in the context of ischemic cardiovascular disease or organ transplantation. Elucidation of the crosstalk between hypoxic response and oxidative stress response will be beneficial for the treatment of these diseases. \\n\\nSTUDY SELECTION AND RESULTS\\nThis review focuses on the molecular crosstalk between the two stress responses, and introduces our findings about the protein factors and chemical compounds that regulate HIF-1\u03b1 and Nrf2. Cellular stress response (CSR) and small Maf protein G (MafG), both of which act in response to oxidative stress, were found to contribute to the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1. Furthermore, Nrf2 was suppressed under hypoxia in a manner independent of Keap1, which is a primary regulatory pathway for Nrf2, and seven in absentia homolog 2 (Siah2) was identified as a new regulator of Nrf2. Siah2 is a ubiquitin ligase of the prolyl hydroxylase domain containing protein (PHD), which contributes to the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1, suggesting that Siah2 regulates both hypoxic and oxidative stress responses. This review also introduces the regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and Nrf2 by phenolic compound, bisphenol A (BPA). \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nHypoxic and oxidative stress responses are regulated by common factors and are closely linked to each other.",

Results The global health/QOL score significantly improved from 44.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027.8 to 53.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.5 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 2 weeks and to 61.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) at 4 weeks. Patients also showed significant increases in physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning at 4 weeks after IVC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the symptom scale, significant relief was observed, especially in the score of fatigue, pain, insomnia, constipation, and financial difficulties. According to the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), attending physicians evaluated the QOL of their patients as minimally to much improved in 46.7% (28/60) and 60.0% (30/60) at 2 and 4 weeks after IVC, respectively. Only 2 patients at 2 weeks and 3 patients at 4 weeks were evaluated as minimally worse. Moreover, all adverse events were mild, and none of the patients discontinued the therapy because of adverse reactions to IVC. Conclusions IVC can safely improve the QOL of cancer patients. These results warrant the conduct of prospective comparative studies to evaluate the usefulness of IVC for patients with advanced cancer.",

METHODS: Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were genotyped by the AmpliChip\u2122 CYP450 Test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ, USA) for 57 patients, who were matched as recurrent versus non-recurrent breast cancers (n = 33 versus n = 24, respectively, with a 5-year follow-up). RESULTS: Based on the genotype data, five CYP2D6 predicted phenotype groups were identified in this study including homozygous extensive metabolizer (13 of 57, 22.80%), extensive/intermediate metabolizer (23 of 57, 40.40%), extensive/poor metabolizer (3 of 57, 5.30%), homozygous intermediate metabolizer (14 of 57, 24.50%), and intermediate/poor metabolizer (4 of 57, 7.00%), and three CYP2C19 genotype groups including homozygous extensive metabolizer (27 of 57, 47.40%), extensive/intermediate metabolizer (27 of 57, 47.40%), and homozygous poor metabolizer (3 of 57, 5.30%). The CYP2D6 variant alleles were *10 (52 of 114, 45.60%), *5 (5 of 114, 4.40%), *41 (2 of 114, 1.80%), *4 (1 of 114, 0.90%), and *36 (1 of 114, 0.90%); the CYP2C19 variant alleles were *2 (27 of 114, 23.70%) and *3 (6 of 114, 5.30%). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed significantly shorter disease-free survival in patients with homozygous TT when compared to those with heterozygous CT or homozygous CC at nucleotides 100C>T and 1039C>T (CYP2D6*10) post-menopausal (log-rank test; P = 0.046). They also had increased risk of recurrence, but no statistically significant association was observed (hazard ratio 3.48; 95% confidence interval 0.86-14.07; P = 0.080). CONCLUSION: The CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms were not involved in tamoxifen efficacy. However, in the subgroup of post-menopausal women, the polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 might be useful in predicting tamoxifen efficacy and clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. As the number of breast cancer patients was relatively small in this study, results should be confirmed in a larger group of prospective patients.",

Analytical methods to specifically evaluate biomarkers predictive of therapeutic efficacy have not been developed. Two randomized phase III trials of carboplatin-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC were used for learning and validating the predictive value of ERCC1 in situ protein levels, as measured by accurate quantitative analysis (AQUA). A novel Bayesian method was applied to identify the outcome-based threshold in the learning trial only. Overall survival (OS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank testing to determine statistical significance in the validating trial. For patients treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin, the median OS was 9.5 months (95% CI 6.7 to 11.8) for the high ERCC1 group compared to 15.6 months (95% CI 11.6 to 24.8) for the low ERCC1 group in the validation trial (log rank p-value = 0.007).

With this population comes the need to evaluate the late and long term effects of cancer treatment and develop recommendations about how to optimally care for these survivors. Lifestyle factors (diet, body weight, physical activity, and smoking) have been linked to a higher risk of many medical comorbidities (cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.). There is increasing evidence linking these factors to the risk of developing cancer and likely cancer-related outcomes. This link has been studied extensively in common cancers like breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers through observational studies and is now being prospectively evaluated in interventional studies. Realizing that survivors are highly motivated to improve their overall health after a diagnosis of cancer, healthy lifestyle recommendations from oncology providers can serve as a strong tool to motivate survivors to adopt health behavior changes.

Ofatumumab effectively induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro, and recent studies demonstrated that ofatumumab also effectively mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that increased exposure to the antibody correlated with improved clinical outcome in CLL. Thus, pharmacogenomics may be important in identifying which patients are more likely to respond to ofatumumab therapy, although such studies have not yet been performed. Patients with the high-affinity FCGR3a 158 V/V polymorphism may be more likely to respond to therapy, if ADCC is the primary in vivo mechanism of action of ofatumumab. Patients with increased expression of the complement defense proteins CD55 and CD59 may be less likely to respond if ofatumumab works in vivo primarily via CDC. Patients with increased metabolism and clear-ance of ofatumumab may have lower exposure and be less likely to respond clinically.

This study examines whether choice predicts outcomes and whether this relationship is mediated by therapeutic alliance. Method: The study sample of 396 participants completed a survey measuring choice, therapeutic alliance, recovery, quality of life and functioning. Multivariate analyses examined choice as a predictor of outcomes, and Sobel tests assessed alliance as a mediator. Results: Choice variables predicted recovery, quality of life and perceived outcomes. Sobel tests indicated that the relationship between choice and outcome variables was mediated by therapeutic alliance. Implications: The study demonstrates that providing more choice and opportunities for collaboration within services does improve consumer outcomes. The results also show that collaboration is dependent on the quality of the relationship between the provider and consumer.",

Among the 134 patients, 73.8% had at least one of the comorbidities, 54.7% had 2\u20134, and only 7.4% had 5\u20138. Comorbidities did not change at 12 months after surgery. Numbers of comorbidities by patients\u2019 self-report and weighted categorization of comorbidities by CCI had a similar negative correlation with overall quality of life scores as well as domains of general health, physical functioning, bodily pain, and vitality. Comorbidities, specifically hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes, were associated with poorer quality of life in multiple domains among breast cancer survivors. Future research should consider the combined influence of comorbidity and cancer on patients\u2019 quality of life.",

        "abstract": "The use of genomics to discover novel targets and biomarkers has placed the field of oncology at the forefront of precision medicine. First-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have transformed the therapeutic landscape of EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung carcinoma through the genetic stratification of tumors from patients with this disease. Somatic EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma are now well established as predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to small-molecule EGFR inhibitors. Despite early patient benefit, primary resistance and subsequent tumor progression to first-generation EGFR inhibitors are seen in 10%-30% of patients with EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Acquired drug resistance is also inevitable, with patients developing disease progression after only 10-13 months of antitumor therapy. This review details strategies pursued in circumventing T790M-mediated drug resistance to EGFR inhibitors, which is the most common mechanism of acquired resistance, and focuses on the clinical development of second-generation EGFR inhibitors, exemplified by afatinib (BIBW2992). We discuss the rationale, mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and toxicity profile of afatinib, including the LUX-Lung studies. We also discuss the emergence of third-generation irreversible mutant-selective inhibitors of EGFR and envision the future management of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma.",

A sample of cells after being stained by using Papanicolaou method is analyzed under microscope for the presence of any unusual developments indicating any precancerous and potentially precancerous changes. Abnormal findings, if observed are subjected to further precise diagnostic subroutines. Examining the cell images for abnormalities in the cervix provides grounds for provision of prompt action and thus reducing incidence and deaths from cervical cancer. It is the most popular technique used for screening of cervical cancer. Pap smear test, if done with a regular screening programs and proper follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer mortality by up to 80% [1]. The contribution of this paper is that we have pioneered to apply hybrid ensemble technique to screen cervical cancer by classification of Pap smear data. The hybrid ensemble designed in this work has also presented an idea to use an ensemble of ensemble techniques. Using such a technique, the classification potentials of individual algorithms are fused together to gain greater classification accuracy. In addition to this we have also presented a comparative analysis of various artificial intelligence based algorithms for screening of cervical cancer. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe results indicate that hybrid ensemble technique is an efficient method for classification of Pap smear images and hence can be effectively used for diagnosis of cervical cancer. Among all the algorithms implemented, the hybrid ensemble approach outperformed & expressed an efficiency of about 96% for 2-class problem and about 78% for 7-class problem. The results when compared with the all the standalone classifiers were significantly better for both 2-class and 7-class problems.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of a patient's cardiac age, or \"heart age\", could prove useful to both patients and physicians for better encouraging lifestyle changes potentially beneficial for cardiovascular health. This may be particularly true for patients who exhibit symptoms but who test negative for cardiac pathology. We developed a statistical model, using a Bayesian approach, that predicts an individual's heart age based on his/her electrocardiogram (ECG). The model is tailored to healthy individuals, with no known risk factors, who are at least 20 years old and for whom a resting 5 min 12-lead ECG has been obtained. We evaluated the model using a database of ECGs from 776 such individuals. Secondarily, we also applied the model to other groups of individuals who had received 5-min ECGs, including 221 with risk factors for cardiac disease, 441 with overt cardiac disease diagnosed by clinical imaging tests, and a smaller group of highly endurance-trained athletes. Model-related heart age predictions in healthy non-athletes tended to center around body age, whereas about three-fourths of the subjects with risk factors and nearly all patients with proven heart diseases had higher predicted heart ages than true body ages. The model also predicted somewhat higher heart ages than body ages in a majority of highly endurance-trained athletes, potentially consistent with possible fibrotic or other anomalies recently noted in such individuals.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Overweight and obesity constitute leading global public health challenges. Tackling overweight and obesity by influencing human behaviour is a complex task, requiring novel emerging health psychology interventions. The aims of this review will be to determine whether mobile devices induce weight loss and improvements in diet and physical activity levels when compared with standard controls without a weight loss intervention or controls allocated to non-mobile device weight loss interventions.\\n\\nMETHODS: A systematic review on mobile devices and weight loss was conducted. The inclusion criteria were all randomized controlled trials with baseline and post-intervention weight measures in adult subjects >18 years of age without pre-specified co-morbidities. Mobile device specifications included modern, portable devices in the form of smartphones, PDAs, iPods, and Mp3 players. Cohen's d for standardized differences in mean weight loss was calculated. A random effects meta-analysis was generated using Comprehensive meta-analysis software. Theories and intervention content were coded and analysed.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 17 studies were identified, of which 12 were primary trials and 5 were secondary analyses. The meta-analysis generated a medium significant effect size of 0.430 (95% CI 0.252-0.609) (p-value \u2264 0.01), favouring mobile interventions. Throughout the systematic review, mobile devices were found to induce weight loss relative to baseline weight. When comparing them with standard no intervention controls as well as controls receiving non-mobile weight loss interventions, results favoured mobile devices for weight loss. Reductions in Body mass index, waist circumference, and percentage body fat were also found in the review. Improvements in the determinants of weight loss in the form of improved dietary intake and physical activity levels were also found. Theory appears to largely inform intervention design, with the most common theories being Social Cognitive Theory, Elaboration Likelihood Theory, Control Theory, and Goal Theory. The use of behavioural change techniques was widespread across the studies, with a minimum of five per intervention.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Mobile devices appear to induce positive changes in the behavioural determinants of weight and subsequently are associated with weight loss. Mobile device interventions are heavily informed by theory and behaviour change techniques. The use of theory appears to effectively enhance levels of constructs targeted by interventions.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that fulvestrant metabolism in humans involves cytochromes P450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). To date, fulvestrant sulfation has not been characterized. This study examined fulvestrant sulfation with nine recombinant sulfotransferases and found that only SULT1A1 and SULT1E1 displayed catalytic activity toward this substrate, with K(m) of 4.2 \u00b1 0.99 and 0.2 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcM, respectively. In vitro assays of 104 human liver cytosols revealed marked individual variability that was highly correlated with \u03b2-naphthol sulfation (SULT1A1 diagnostic substrate; r = 0.98, P < 0.0001), but not with 17\u03b2-estradiol sulfation (SULT1E1 diagnostic substrate; r = 0.16, P = 0.10). Fulvestrant sulfation was correlated with both SULT1A1*1/2 genotype (P value = 0.023) and copy number (P < 0.0001). These studies suggest that factors influencing SULT1A1/1E1 tissue expression and/or enzymatic activity could influence the efficacy of fulvestrant therapy.",

Public trust in such systems that share health information for research and health care practice is understudied. Our research examines characteristics of the general public that predict trust in a health system that includes researchers, health care providers, insurance companies and public health departments. We created a 119-item survey of predictors and attributes of system trust and fielded it using Amazon\u2019s MTurk system (n = 447). We found that seeing one\u2019s primary care provider, having a favorable view of data sharing and believing that data sharing will improve the quality of health care, as well as psychosocial factors (altruism and generalized trust) were positively and significantly associated with system trust. As expected, privacy concern, but counterintuitively, knowledge about health information sharing were negatively associated with system trust. We conclude that, in order to assure the public\u2019s trust, policy makers charged with setting best practices for governance of biobanks and access to electronic health records should leverage critical access points to engage a diverse public in joint decision making.",

Technology advancements over the past decade, since the first human genome was decoded, have made it feasible to use WGS for clinical care. Future advancements will likely drive down the price to the point wherein WGS is routinely available for care. However, were this to happen today, most of the genetic information available to guide clinical care would go unused due to the complexity of genetics, limited physician proficiency in genetics, and lack of genetics professionals in the clinical workforce. Furthermore, these limitations are unlikely to change in the future. As such, the use of clinical decision support (CDS) to guide genome-guided clinical decision-making is imperative. In this manuscript, we describe the barriers to widespread clinical application of WGS information, describe how CDS can be an important tool for overcoming these barriers, and provide clinical examples of how genome-enabled CDS can be used in the clinical setting.",

Despite efforts to increase both the quality and quantity of samples collected, access to such samples remains limited. This may be due, at least in part, to a general reluctance of biobanking professionals, clinicians, and researchers to share biological specimens with others. Ethnographic methods were used in a biobank setting to explore professionals' perspectives toward and practices of sharing samples. Several motivations and barriers to sharing that may influence research practice were identified. Contrary to existing literature that suggests that professionals are unlikely to share samples with one another, the participants of this study were open to and supportive of sharing samples for research. However, clear communication and effective infrastructure are needed to support the distribution of biobank materials.",

Logistic regression (LR), Bayesian network (BN) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed. The best-fitted models were tested on the remaining unseen data and compared to either the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) for the ICU patients, or the EuroSCORE for the cardiac surgery patients. Local customized mortality prediction models performed better as compared to the corresponding current standard severity scoring system for all three subsets of patients: patients with acute kidney injury (AUC = 0.875 for ANN, vs. SAPS, AUC = 0.642), patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (AUC = 0.958 for BN, vs. SAPS, AUC = 0.84), and elderly patients undergoing open heart surgery (AUC = 0.94 for ANN, vs. EuroSCORE, AUC = 0.648).

This study aimed to assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of measurements taken by physiotherapists of legs and arms with and without lymphedema and to evaluate whether there is a difference in reliability when measuring a healthy versus a lymphedematous limb. The intra-rater reliability of arm and leg measurements by trained physiotherapist is very high (scaled standard error of measurements (SEMs) for an arm and a leg volume were 0.82% and 0.64%, respectively) and a cut-point of 1% scaled SEM may be recommended as a threshold for acceptable reliability. Physiotherapists can rely on the same error when assessing lymphedematous or healthy limbs. For those who work in teams and share patients, practice is needed in synchronizing the measurements and regularly monitoring their inter-rater reliability.",

In this article we describe some of the most interesting cases of CYP poor metabolisers associated with adverse reactions to psychotropic drugs. Prevention of disease/illness, including Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR), is an aim of modern medicine. Scientific data supports the fact that evaluation of drug toxicology includes several factors, one of which is genetic variations in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drug pathways. These variations are only a part of toxicity evaluation, however, even if it would help to prevent only a small percentage of patients from suffering adverse drug reactions, especially life threatening ADRs, pharmacogenetic testing should play a significant role in any modern psychopharmacologic practice. Medical practitioners should also consider the use of other medications or alternative dosing strategies for drugs in patients identified as altered metabolisers. This will promise not only better and safer treatments for patients, but also potentially lowering overall healthcare costs.",

In an age of ubiquitous online networking and rapid development of social networking tools, understanding how consumers share personal genetic risk assessments is critical in the development of appropriate and effective policies. This exploratory study investigates how consumers share personal genetic information and attitudes towards social networking behaviors. Methods: Adult participants aged 23 to 72 years old who purchased direct-to-consumer genetic testing from a personal genomics company were administered a web-based survey regarding their sharing activities and social networking behaviors related to their personal genetic test results. Results: 80 participants completed the survey; of those, 45% shared results on Facebook and 50.9% reported meeting or reconnecting with more than 10 other individuals through the sharing of their personal genetic information. For help interpreting test results, 70.4% turned to Internet websites and online sources, compared to 22.7% who consulted their healthcare providers. Amongst participants, 51.8% reported that they believe the privacy of their personal genetic information would be breached in the future. Conclusion: Consumers actively utilize online social networking tools to help them share and interpret their personal genetic information. These findings suggest a need for careful consideration of policy recommendations in light of the current ambiguity of regulation and oversight of consumer initiated sharing activities.",

We elucidated the mechanisms underlying the adenosine-induced anticancer effects. \\n\\nSTUDY SECTION AND RESULTS\\nExtrinsic pathway analysis showed that extracellular adenosine induces apoptosis in CW2 human colon cancer and RCR-1 rat astrocytoma cells through the A1 adenosine receptor; in Caco-2 human colon cancer and HepG2 human hepatoma cells through the A2a adenosine receptor; and through the A3 adenosine receptor in A549, Lu-65, and SBC-3 human lung cancer cells, RCC4-VHL human renal cancer cells, 5637 human bladder cancer cells, and human malignant pleural mesothelioma cells. In the intrinsic pathways, intracellularly transported adenosine induces apoptosis in GT3-TKB human lung cancer cells, human malignant pleural mesothelioma cells, HuH-7 and HepG2 human hepatoma cells, and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by a) activating AMPK, b) upregulating p53, c) downregulating c-FLIP expression, d) neutralizing caspase-3 inhibition due to inhibition of apoptosis protein (IAP) in cooperation with DIABLO, e) accumulating AMID in the nucleus, f) regulating apoptosis-related gene transcription, or g) promoting GATA-2-regulated p53 gene transcription. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAdenosine exerts its anticancer action on a wide variety of cancer cell types through diverse signaling pathways. Therefore, adenosine and its signaling cascades can be useful as possible targets in the development of promising anticancer therapies.",

While many of these programs have been shown to predict accurately the effect of SNPs in functional areas of the gene, such as 5' upstream or coding regions, empiric research may be warranted to confirm the functional consequences of SNPs that are predicted to have little to no effect. We compared predictions from FASTSNP (Function Analysis and Selection Tool for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and F-SNP (Functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) with experimentally derived genotype-phenotype correlations to determine the accuracy of these programs in predicting SNP functionality. We used normal colon tissue to evaluate 24 TagSNPs within six genes. Two of 16 SNPs that were predicted to have no functional effect in FASTSNP were significantly associated with gene expression. Only one of the eight SNPs that were predicted to have a low to high effect was significantly associated with gene expression. While the two in silico programs that were used were similar in their results for the SNPs predicted by FASTSNP to have no effect, of SNPs with scores from low to high, there were three that received an F-SNP score below what is considered functionally significant. In silico programs can fail to identify functional SNPs, supporting a continuing role for empiric analysis of SNP function. Laboratory analysis is necessary to identify causal SNPs accurately, establish biological plausibility of the effect, and ultimately inform cancer prevention strategies.",

Researchers have identified factors influencing uptake of genomics in medicine, but little is known about the specific technical barriers to incorporating PGx into existing clinical frameworks. We present the design and development of a prototype PGx clinical decision support (CDS) system that builds on existing clinical infrastructure and incorporates semi-active and active CDS. Informing this work, we updated previous evaluations of PGx knowledge characteristics, and of how the CDS capabilities of three local clinical systems align with data and functional requirements for PGx CDS. We summarize characteristics of PGx knowledge and technical needs for implementing PGx CDS within existing clinical frameworks. PGx decision support rules derived from FDA drug labels primarily involve drug metabolizing genes, vary in maturity, and the majority support the post-analytic phase of genetic testing. Computerized provider order entry capabilities are key functional requirements for PGx CDS and were best supported by one of the three systems we evaluated. We identified two technical needs when building on this system, the need for (1) new or existing standards for data exchange to connect clinical data to PGx knowledge, and (2) a method for implementing semi-active CDS. Our analyses enhance our understanding of principles for designing and implementing CDS for drug therapy individualization and our current understanding of PGx characteristics in a clinical context. Characteristics of PGx knowledge and capabilities of current clinical systems can help govern decisions about CDS implementation, and can help guide decisions made by groups that develop and maintain knowledge resources such that delivery of content for clinical care is supported.",

General practitioners and specialists were recruited in a major metropolitan area in Australia. Interview transcripts were reviewed by two independent researchers, and thematic analysis was performed using NVivo10 software. The main barriers and motivators identified were: (1) clinician-related (e.g., familiarity with Lynch syndrome and family history knowledge); (2) patient-related (e.g., patients' interests and personal experience with cancer); and (3) organizational-related (e.g., access to services, guidelines and referral pathway). Referral of patients with suspected Lynch syndrome to cancer genetic services is motivated and hindered by a range of individual, interpersonal and organizational factors. In order to improve the care and quality of life of patients and family with suspected Lynch syndrome, further research is needed to develop supportive tools for clinicians.",

Among 441 subjects, 133 experienced REC and/or an SPT, while 308 had single primary disease. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the exact copy number of GSTM1 and direct sequencing was used to determine genetic variants in the GSTM1 promoter region. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with copy number and genetic variants. REC/SPT-free survival times were compared by constructing Kaplan-Meier curves and differences between curves were tested by logrank test. Results showed a significantly decreased REC/SPT (HR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.35-0.95) and longer REC/SPT-free survival in subjects with at least two copies of GSTM1 compared with the GSTM1 homozygous deletion, but not in those with one copy of GSTM1. The -498G, -426G, and -339T alleles were significantly associated with REC/SPT, with HRs of 0.11 (0.02-0.85), 0.28 (0.11-0.74) and 2.02 (1.07-3.82), respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the -498G, -426G, and -339C alleles were also significantly associated with increased REC/SPT-free survival. Further haplotype analysis showed the haplotype P(-498G--426G--339C) carriers had decreased REC/SPT with a HR of 0.09 (95% CI 0.01-0.71) and increased REC/SPT-free survival compared with those with haplotype P(-498C--426A--339T). The P(-498C--426A--339T)-containing reporter construct had significantly increased luciferase expression. These results suggest that the GSTM1 CNV and promoter haplotype are better predictors of REC/SPTs of head and neck cancer than just measuring the presence/absence of GSTM1.",

Primary care patients (n = 58) who were nonadherent to statins and their providers received SLCO1B1*5 genotyping and guided recommendations via the electronic medical record (EMR). The primary outcome was the change in Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire, which measured patients' perceived needs for statins and concerns about adverse effects, measured before and after SLCO1B1*5 results. Concurrent controls (n = 59) were identified through the EMR to compare secondary outcomes: new statin prescriptions, statin utilization, and change in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c).

The impacts of genetic variants on disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: The ABCB1 3435 C>T was found to have the highest allele frequency among other variants; however, CYP3A4*1B/*18 could not be found in this study. Patients with heterozygous ABCB1 3435 CT genotype showed significantly shorter DFS than those with homozygous 3435 CC genotype (P = 0.041). In contrast, patients who carried homozygous 3435 TT genotype showed no difference in DFS from wild-type 3435 CC patients. Cox regression analysis showed that the relative risk of recurrence was increased by five times (P = 0.043; hazard ratio = 5.11; 95% confidence interval: 1.05-24.74) in those patients carrying ABCB1 3435 CT genotype compared to those with ABCB1 3435 CC.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: ABCB1 3435 C>T is likely to have a clinically significant impact on recurrence risk in Thai patients with breast cancer who receive tamoxifen adjuvant therapy.",

Mobile technology (mHealth) offers a potential solution to increase reach of CR. This paper presents two development studies to determine mobile phone usage in adults with CVD and to evaluate the acceptability of an mHealth healthy eating CR program. Methods: CR attendees were surveyed to determine mobile phone usage rates. A second single-subject pilot study investigated perceptions of a 4-week theory-based healthy eating mHealth program and explored pre-post changes in self-efficacy. Results: 74 adults with CVD completed the survey (50/74 male; mean age 63 + 10). Nearly all had mobile phones (70/74; 95%) and used the Internet (69/74; 93%), and most were interested in receiving CR by text message (57/74; 77%). 20 participants took part in the healthy eating pilot study. Participants read all/most of the text messages, and most (19/20) thought using mobile technology was a good way to deliver the program. The website was not widely used as visiting the website was reported to be time consuming. Exploratory t-tests revealed an increase in heart healthy eating self-efficacy post program, in particular the environmental self-efficacy subset (Mean = 0.62, SD = 0.74, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Text messaging was seen as a simple and acceptable way to deliver nutrition information and behavior change strategies; however, future research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such programs. 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Most of APW analysis frameworks individually process each hemodynamic parameter and do not evaluate inter-dependencies in the overall pulse morphology. The key contribution of this work is the use of machine learning algorithms to deal with vectorized features extracted from APW. With this purpose, we follow a five-step evaluation methodology: (1) a custom-designed, non-invasive, electromechanical device was used in the data collection from 50 subjects; (2) the acquired position and amplitude of onset, Systolic Peak (SP), Point of Inflection (Pi) and Dicrotic Wave (DW) were used for the computation of some morphological attributes; (3) pre-processing work on the datasets was performed in order to reduce the number of input features and increase the model accuracy by selecting the most relevant ones; (4) classification of the dataset was carried out using four different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, BayesNet (probabilistic), J48 (decision tree) and RIPPER (rule-based induction); and (5) we evaluate the trained models, using the majority-voting system, comparatively to the respective calculated Augmentation Index (AIx). Classification algorithms have been proved to be efficient, in particular Random Forest has shown good accuracy (96.95%) and high area under the curve (AUC) of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (0.961). Finally, during validation tests, a correlation between high risk labels, retrieved from the multi-parametric approach, and positive AIx values was verified. This approach gives allowance for designing new hemodynamic morphology vectors and techniques for multiple APW analysis, thus improving the arterial pulse understanding, especially when compared to traditional single-parameter analysis, where the failure in one parameter measurement component, such as Pi, can jeopardize the whole evaluation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physicians attempt to achieve glycemic goals in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through various means, including glucose-lowering medications. There is interindividual variability in response to medications, which can be partially explained by the presence of genetic polymorphisms that affect drug metabolism. Pharmacogenomics studies the hereditary basis of interpatient variations in drug response and aims to identify subgroups of patients whose drug management could be tailored accordingly. The aim of this review is to explore patient profiling in the management of T2DM with a focus on the sodium glucose transporter inhibitor canagliflozin. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched using the terms \"pharmacogenomics\" and \"diabetes\" through May 31, 2014. Published articles and abstracts presented at national/international meetings were considered. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Genome-wide association studies have opened the door for patient profiling and research into genetic variants in multifactorial T2DM. Clinically, it may be possible to tailor the type of medication used based on the presence or absence of the various genetic variants. However, the polymorphisms studied may only explain some of the variability in response to T2DM drugs and needs further validation to ensure its authenticity. There are still unidentified factors which appear to play a role in the interindividual variability seen in clinical practice. The potential exists for pharmacogenomics to promote efficacious, safe, and cost-effective individualized diabetes management. Pharmacogenomics is still in its early stages, and the idea of defining patients genetically to predict individual responses to drugs and obtain safe and effective T2DM management is promising, in spite of existing barriers. Currently, clinical profiling of patients with T2DM and using an individualized approach with most drugs, including canagliflozin, based on comorbid conditions still remains the most accepted approach for the management of T2DM.",

The present study investigated the effects of the CYP2D6 polymorphisms, including CYP2D6*10, on the pharmacokinetic parameters of paroxetine in Japanese patients with major depressive disorders. This retrospective study included 15 Japanese patients with major depressive disorders (four males and eleven females) who were treated with paroxetine. The CYP2D6*2, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*5, CYP2D6*10, CYP2D6*18, CYP2D6*39, and CYP2D6*41 polymorphisms were evaluated. A total of 56 blood samples were collected from the patients. The Km and Vmax values of paroxetine were estimated for each patient. The allele frequencies of CYP2D6*2, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*5, CYP2D6*10, CYP2D6*18, CYP2D6*39, and CYP2D6*41 were 6.7%, 0%, 10.0%, 56.7%, 0%, 26.7%, and 0%, respectively. The mean values of Km and Vmax were 50.5\u00b168.4 ng/mL and 50.6\u00b118.8 mg/day, respectively. Both the Km and Vmax values were significantly smaller in CYP2D6*10 allele carriers than in the noncarriers (24.2\u00b118.3 ng/mL versus 122.5\u00b1106.3 ng/mL, P=0.008; 44.2\u00b116.1 mg/day versus 68.3\u00b115.0 mg/day, P=0.022, respectively). This is the first study to demonstrate that the CYP2D6*10 polymorphism could affect the nonlinear pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of paroxetine in Asian populations. The findings of this study suggest that the CYP2D6*10 polymorphism may be associated with the smaller values of both the Km and Vmax in Japanese patients with major depressive disorders, and these results need to be confirmed in further investigations with a larger number of patients.",

This study aimed to understand potentially mutable attitudes and opinions commonly correlated with biobank participation in order to inform approaches to promote participation in biobanks. METHODS: Adults from two University of Maryland (UMD) Faculty Physicians, Inc. outpatient practices were invited to watch a video and complete a survey about a new biobank initiative. We used: Chi-square to assess the relationship between willingness to join the biobank and participant characteristics, other potentially mutable attitudes and opinions, and trust in the UMD. We also used t-test to assess the relationship with trust in medical research. We also prioritize proposed actions to improve attitudes and opinions about joining biobanks according to perceived responsiveness. RESULTS: 169 participants completed the study, 51% of whom indicated a willingness to join the biobank. Willingness to join the biobank was not associated with age, gender, race, or education but was associated with respondent comfort sharing samples and clinical information, concerns related to confidentiality, potential for misuse of information, trust in UMD, and perceived health benefit. In ranked order, potential actions we surveyed that might alleviate some of these concerns include: increase chances to learn more about the biobank, increase opportunities to be updated, striving to put community concerns first, including involving community members as leaders of biobank research, and involving community members in decision making. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several attitudes and opinions that influence decisions to join a biobank, including many concerns that could potentially be addressed by engaging community members. We also demonstrate our method of prioritizing ways to improve attitudes and opinions about joining a biobank according to perceived responsiveness.",

Most respondents demonstrated suboptimal knowledge of Lynch syndrome. Male general practitioners who have been practicing for \u226510 years were less likely to offer genetic referral than specialists, and many clinicians did not recognize that immunohistochemistry testing is not a germline test. Half of all general practitioners did not actually refer patients in the past 12 months, and 30% of them did not feel that their role is to identify patients for genetic referral. The majority of clinicians considered everyone to be responsible for making the initial referral to genetic services, but a small preference was given to oncologists (15%) and general practitioners (13%). Patient information brochures, continuing genetic education programs and referral guidelines were favoured as support for practice. Targeted education interventions should be considered to improve referral.

Participants universally noted positive effects on patient care, including increases in quality, personalization of care and patient engagement. The impact on clinical workflow varied by practice setting, with differences observed in the ease of integration and the use of specific report elements. Tension between the length of the report and desired detail was appreciated. Barriers and facilitators to the process of implementation were noted, dominated by the theme of increased integration with the electronic medical record. These results fed real-time improvement cycles to reinforce clinician use. This model will be applied in future institutional efforts to integrate clinical genomic applications into practice and may be useful for other institutions considering the implementation of tools for personalizing medical management.",

However, the extent of the communication process and provision of information to patients about pharmacogenetics is unclear. Pharmacogenetic information may be included in sections of a drug's package insert intended for patients, which is provided directly to patients or communicated via the health provider. To determine what pharmacogenetic information, if any, is included in patient-targeted sections of the drug label, we reviewed the labels listed in the US Food and Drug Administration's Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels. To date, 140 drugs include pharmacogenetic-related information in the approved label. Our analysis revealed that pharmacogenetic information is included in patient-targeted sections for a minority (n=29; 21%) of drug labels, with no obvious pattern associated with the inclusion of pharmacogenetic information. Therefore, patients are unlikely to learn about pharmacogenetics through written materials dispensed with the drug. Given that there are also inconsistencies with regard to inclusion of pharmacogenetic information in the patient counseling information section, it is also unlikely that patients are receiving adequate pharmacogenetic information from their provider. The inconsistent presence of pharmacogenetic information in patient-targeted sections of drug labels suggests a need to review the criteria for inclusion of information in patient-targeted sections in order to increase consistency and patient knowledge of pharmacogenetic information.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Positive emotions via laughter or meditation contribute to physiological and psychological health. In this review, we summarize how positive emotions affect gene expression in humans and an animal model. Study selection and results: Our first studies demonstrated that mirthful laughter reduced a postprandial elevation in blood glucose levels in type II diabetes patients and increased the expression of genes related to natural killer cell activity. Furthermore, laughter decreased the plasma prorenin level, a marker for the progression of diabetic complications, and normalized the expression level of the prorenin receptor gene in peripheral blood leukocytes. These findings suggest a preventive effect of laughter on the exacerbation of diabetic conditions, which is accompanied by changes in the expression of discriminating genes. Our next study examined the effects of tactile stimulation (tickling) on socially isolated adolescent rats. Evoking positive emotions by tickling influenced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and altered the expression of genes related to feeding regulation, blood pressure control, and biological rhythms in the corpus striatum and hypothalamus. Thus, positive emotions via tickling can regulate gene expression in the rat brain in a site-specific manner. Lastly, we review the relevant research of other groups. Meditation, a widely known healing technique, altered the expression of genes associated with cellular metabolism and oxidative stress responses, suggesting the inhibition of cell injury due to chronic stress.

Akita University Hospital provided medical support to earthquake-affected areas in Rikuzentakata City, Iwate Prefecture. The 11th team, out of 27 Akita University Hospital Medical support teams, provided medical support service including Kampo, traditional Japanese medicine, from April 17 to 20, 2011. However, out of the 210 Kampo preparations, only 11 were available. Kampo medicines were prescribed for 13 patients for 3 days. The patients presented with symptoms of arthralgia and myalgia caused by coldness of the body, skin manifestations caused by a lack of bathing, respiratory disorders due to pollen dispersal and dust, and depression due to the loss of family. Kampo medicines were effective for treating both physical and mental distress even in unusual circumstances. Hence, Kampo medicine is potentially useful in relief efforts in disaster-stricken areas.",

        "abstract": "CYP3A ranks among the most abundant cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver, playing a dominant role in metabolic elimination of clinically used drugs. A main member in CYP3A family, CYP3A4 expression and activity vary considerably among individuals, attributable to genetic and non-genetic factors, affecting drug dosage and efficacy. However, the extent of genetic influence has remained unclear. This review assesses current knowledge on the genetic factors influencing CYP3A4 activity. Coding region CYP3A4 polymorphisms are rare and account for only a small portion of inter-person variability in CYP3A metabolism. Except for the promoter allele CYP3A4*1B with ambiguous effect on expression, common CYP3A4 regulatory polymorphisms were thought to be lacking. Recent studies have identified a relatively common regulatory polymorphism, designated CYP3A4*22 with robust effects on hepatic CYP3A4 expression. Combining CYP3A4*22 with CYP3A5 alleles *1, *3 and *7 has promise as a biomarker predicting overall CYP3A activity. Also contributing to variable expression, the role of polymorphisms in transcription factors and microRNAs is discussed.",

Here, we elucidated the sphingosine signaling pathways underlying apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. \\n\\nSTUDY SECTION AND RESULTS\\nSphingosine induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in rat hippocampal neurons and astrocytes by activating caspase-3/-9 via the sphingosine-dependent protein kinase (SDK)/14-3-3 protein/Bax/cytochrome c pathway. This may account for the implication of sphingosine/SDK in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, sphingosine induced apoptosis in MKN-28 human gastric cancer cells in an SDK-dependent manner. In the human malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines, sphingosine suppressed cell growth by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, along with inhibiting protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4). This suggests that sphingosine/SDK/PKC\u03b4 signaling can be potentially used in treating many types of cancers. \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe present review shows that sphingosine induces apoptosis and inhibits the cell cycle by targeting SDK and PKC\u03b4. Our findings represent a fresh insight into sphingosine signaling pathways, and may provide a blueprint for developing drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease and many types of cancers.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\\nLung cancer is responsible for most cancer-related deaths. There are two broad types of lung tumors, usually classified as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Current clinicopathological staging systems provide the advantage of standardized criteria for assessing tumor stage, and a relationship between advancing tumor stage and poor prognosis has been established for NSCLC. However, these staging systems have not led to clear criteria for selection of therapy for individual patients with NSCLC. The concept of therapy based on anatomical location, as used in staging systems, is poorly associated with the cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics of individual tumor tissues. CSCs may have self-renewal and multipotent differentiation abilities and be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis; they are highly resistant to chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, research into CSCs will provide the basis for developing of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We review aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1), CD133, CD44 and CD166 as CSC markers, as weel as the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, KRAS, and the embryonic stem cell (ESC) signature. \\n\\nSTUDY SELECTION\\nPubMed databases were searched for relevant articles. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe positivity rate for ALDH1 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining is 19% in patients with stage I NSCLC [1]. The positivity rates for CD133 are 19\u201348.9% [2\u20134] and for CD44 are 50.4\u201367.3% in patients with NSCLC [5,6]. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nCSCs have been identified in lung cancer and will provide new therapeutic targets for lung cancer. Research on these cells could improve the prognosis of lung cancer.",

Atrophic vaginitis, caused by decreased levels of circulating estrogen to urinary and vaginal receptors, is commonly experienced by this group. Chemotherapy induced ovarian failure and endocrine therapies including aromatase inhibitors and selective estrogen receptor modulators can trigger the onset of atrophic vaginitis or exacerbate existing symptoms. Symptoms of atrophic vaginitis include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and irritation of genital skin, pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge, and soreness. The diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis is confirmed through patient-reported symptoms and gynecological examination of external structures, introitus, and vaginal mucosa. Lifestyle modifications can be helpful but are usually insufficient to significantly improve symptoms. Non-hormonal vaginal therapies may provide additional relief by increasing vaginal moisture and fluid. Systemic estrogen therapy is contraindicated in breast cancer survivors. Continued investigations of various treatments for atrophic vaginitis are necessary. Local estrogen-based therapies, DHEA, testosterone, and pH-balanced gels continue to be evaluated in ongoing studies. Definitive results are needed pertaining to the safety of topical estrogens in breast cancer survivors.",

We challenged genetically diverse inbred lines of mice from the Collaborative Cross with bleomycin to determine the heritability of this phenotype. Sibling pairs of mice from 40 lines were treated with bleomycin. Lung disease was assessed by scoring lung pathology and by measuring soluble collagen levels in lavage fluid. Serum micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) were also measured. Inbred sibling pairs of animals demonstrated high coinheritance of the phenotypes of disease susceptibility or disease resistance. The plasma levels of one miRNA were clearly correlated in sibling mice. The results showed that, as in humans, the lines that comprise the Collaborative Cross exhibited wide genetic variation in response to this drug.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of CF extract (Forskohlii, DHC Corporation) in healthy volunteers. A dose escalation study was performed to determine the type and frequency of adverse events. Twenty-nine healthy subjects were recruited in an open-label trial and were administered escalating doses from 250 to 1000\u00a0mg over a 4-week period. Patients were examined on a daily basis for adverse events. Blood, urine, and stool samples were obtained before and after supplementation in a subset of 10 subjects to assess the safety of the supplement. All 29 subjects completed the study. Intake of CF was associated with minor gastrointestinal adverse events such as soft stool and diarrhea, which appeared to be dose-related. There were no major adverse events. At each dose of CF, either 6 or 7 subjects reported minor GI events.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Estrogen is known to decrease the risk of colon cancer in postmenopausal women, and may exert its actions by decreasing interleukin-6 (IL6) production via stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB). Estrogens are biosynthesized by CYP19A1 (aromatase), so it is possible that genetic variations in CYP19A1 influences the risk of colon cancer by altering expression of CYP19A1. Further, studies on gene-gene interactions suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms in one gene may affect expression of other genes. The current study aims to explore the role of CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms on CYP19A1, NFkappaB1 and IL6 gene expression. METHODS: Phenotype-genotype associations, cross-associations between genes, and haplotype analyses were performed in both normal human colon (n=82) and liver (n=238) samples. RESULTS: CYP19A1 rs10459592, rs1961177, and rs6493497 were associated with CYP19A1 expression in colon samples (P=0.042, P=0.041, and P=0.013, respectively). CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs12908960, rs730154, rs8025191, and rs17523880) were correlated with NFkappaB1 expression (P=0.047, P=0.04, P=0.05, and P=0.03, respectively), and CYP19A1 rs11856927, rs2470152, and rs2470144 (P=0.049, P=0.025, P=0.047, respectively) were associated with IL6 expression in the colon. While rs730154 and rs17523880 could not be analyzed in the liver samples, none of the other associations with the colon were replicated in the liver samples. Haplotype analysis revealed three separate haplotypes of the CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphism that were significantly associated with CYP19A1, NFkappaB1, and IL6 gene expression. CONCLUSION: CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated not only with CYP19A1 expression but also with NFkappaB1 and IL6 expression. These data demonstrate the possible functional consequences of genetic variation within the CYP19A1 gene on other genes in a biologically plausible pathway.",

Materials and methods Symptoms, clinical parameters and serum metabolites were measured before and after 4 and 8 weeks of R6 treatment. Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis was applied for the first time to conduct an integrated analysis of the three data sets. Correlation structures were compared before treatment and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Additionally, a State Space Grid approach was used to study personalized changes in symptom profiles. Results The symptoms 'hectic fever' and 'spontaneous sweating' were found to be most relieved during R6 treatment. Most of the symptoms were less correlated with other variables after 8 weeks of R6 treatment. LDL-C, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and waist size were found to decrease during R6 treatment. Additionally, 10 of the 15 measured phosphatidylcholines were found to decrease. Personalized symptom profiles as described by Chinese medical terms show that most Yin deficiencies are addressed first by R6 treatment. However, in subjects with reduced or less Yin deficiency but which do have a substantial Qi deficiency a reduction of Qi deficiency is subsequently observed. Conclusions R6 treatment was shown to improve the lipid profile indicating a reduction of cardiovascular risk. Additionally, the changes observed in correlation structure indicate a different angle of looking at treatment effects. Less strong correlations between symptoms and metabolites suggest a healthier situation after R6 treatment. A State Space Grid analysis showed that the effect of R6 was different for the Yin deficiency subjects and the Qi deficiency subjects. The observed decrease of Yin deficiency related symptoms is in agreement with the use of R6 in Chinese medicine to nourish Yin. Observing individual differences in treatment effects is therefore an essential step in the development of personalized medicine. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In 2011, genetic privacy bills were introduced in two US states proposing that genetic information and material are an individual\u2019s exclusive property. Using the bills as a catalyst for broader discussion, the author introduces several themes. On a primary level, the scientific, medical, and broader community should be cognizant of the bills as they may be precursors to new legislation with potential future impact on genomics and personalized medicine. Their privacythrough- property approach contains definitional ambiguities (such as using the legal phraseology of \u201creal property\u201d), erects barriers to research and innovation, differs conceptually and procedurally from current genetic privacy legislation, and could herald a return to reductionist genetic exceptionalism. Since genetic research and personalized medicine operate in a borderless (transnational) world where natural and social system divisions are highly porous, patchwork legislation can impede advancement of knowledge transfer, health outcome delivery, and international harmonization and coordination. While these are US bills, they can set precedence with potential traction in globally networked innovation ecosystems that share, and are shaped by, legislation and international norms. Too often, law and science are artificially situated in silos. Yet law is not a disembodied system of ideas; it is a corpus embedded in a larger social structure that includes science and personalized medicine. Broader elements of society must be engaged and educated from the earliest stage of legal reform so that future legislation that impacts genomics and personalized medicine can be steered in a form more closely tuned to social values and the lessons learned from the past history of genetic/genomics research.",

For more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance-for example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. Computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. We present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. Partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. Our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. We present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques.",

Translation of basic research findings to clinical applications within regulatory compliance is required for personalized medicine to become the new foundation for practice of medicine. Deploying even a few of the thousands of potential diagnostic biomarkers identified each year as part of personalized treatment workflows requires clinically efficient biosensor technologies to monitor multiple biomarkers in patients in real time. This paper discusses a critical component of a regulatory system, a microcavity optical biosensor for label-free monitoring of biomolecular interactions at physiologically-relevant concentrations. While most current biosensor research focuses on improving sensitivity, this paper emphasizes other characteristics a biosensor technology requires to be practical in a clinical setting, presenting robust microcavity biosensors which are easy to manufacture and integrate with microfluidics into flexible and redesignable platforms making the microcavity biosensors deployable for continuous monitoring of biomarkers in body fluids in the clinic, \u00a0in dense 2D random arrays for high-throughput applications like drug-library screening in interactomics, and of the secretory behavior of single cells in the laboratory.",

Unstructured management of patients with AF sharply contrasts with our detailed, although incomplete, knowledge of the mechanisms that cause AF and its complications. Altered calcium homeostasis, atrial fibrosis and ageing, ion-channel dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, fat-cell infiltration, and oxidative stress, in addition to a susceptible genetic background, contribute to the promotion, maintenance, and progression of AF. However, clinical management of patients with AF is currently guided by stroke risk parameters, AF pattern, and symptoms. In response to this apparent disconnect between the known pathophysiology of AF and clinical management, we propose a roadmap to develop a set of clinical markers that reflect the major causes of AF in patients. Thereby, the insights into the mechanisms causing AF will be transformed into a format that can underpin future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF, ultimately informing better patient care.",

Targeted (biological) therapy has brought new horizons in rheumatology. As it is a rather expensive treatment modality, it has been urgent to develop tools suitable for the prediction of therapeutic responses. Several clinical, immunological and genetic biomarkers have been established for this purpose. Among clinical markers, male sex, younger age, lower or even higher disease activity at baseline, combination treatment and quitting smoking may lead to better treatment outcome. Immunological biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein, seropositivity, peripheral blood or synovial cellular content have been associated with therapeutic responses. Finally, numerous genes or gene signatures may also predict the efficacy or safety of immunosuppressive drugs. Although sometimes there have been only few studies conducted that led to some controversy, some biomarkers have also been validated. This may lead us to optimism in terms of wider acceptance of personalized medicine in rheumatology.",

The challenge is to distinguish the key mutations driving the cancer from the background of mutational noise and find ways to effectively target them.

The overarching aim is to make recommendations for global health policy that will benefit from advances in personalized genomics knowledge in the context of food. The discussion explores the challenging possibility of intergenerational transfer and retention of environmental signals and imprints on the genome. In addition, the article draws on the socio-ethical aspects of making decisions about how to use that information in order to benefit present and future generations equitably. Personalized nutrition genomics could benefit from unique epigenetic signatures of individuals for the purposes of personalized dietary interventions. An epigenetic information society will face obvious social choices between a policy of laissez-faire versus a policy of intervention and rehabilitation in global health. Some will also undoubtedly argue that the inevitability of natural selection invariably points to not intervening (too much, if at all) in such a transgenerational way (if we can help it) as the genome will adapt to any viable environmental stress through its inherent plasticity, regardless of the resulting social conditions through which it materializes.

        "abstract": "Several lines of evidence indicate that apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays a central role in the brain's response to injury and neurodegeneration in the adult. The coordinated expression of apoE and several of its accessory proteins appears to regulate the transport and internalization of cholesterol and phospholipids during development and normal brain reinnervation in the adult. The discovery, a few years ago, that a genetic variant in the apoE gene called apoE4 strongly links to both sporadic and familial late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised the possibility that a dysfunction of the lipid transport system in the brain could be central to AD pathophysiology. Pathophysiological evidence obtained in autopsy-confirmed sporadic AD cases clearly indicate that the presence of apoE4 allele in humans directly compromises cholinergic function in the adult brain and indirectly modulate the efficacy of medications designed to enhance the cholinergic activity in diseased brain. The apoE4 allele was found to significantly increase the risk of progression to dementia for persons exhibiting amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a transitional state between the cognitive changes associated with normal aging and early AD. Furthermore, two accessory enzymes involved in cholinergic neurotransmission called butyrylcholinesterase and paraoxonase-1 were shown i) to display polymorphic variants that increase the risk of developing AD and ii) to modulate drug responsiveness in AD subjects exposed to cholinomimetic agents. This article reviews the most critical findings in this field and reassess the potent clinical value of pharmacogenomics of neurodegenerative diseases and dementia.

These principles have been applied to cancer vaccines. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Various cancer vaccines that can be personalized. Tumor-derived vaccines have been used and active immunotherapy based on antigens specific to the tumor. Dendritic cells (DCs) can prime tumor-specific T cell responses and are considered potentially effective vaccines for cancer. DCs may be genetically modified or fused with tumor cells. Adoptive cell therapy is based on autologous antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Personalized peptide vaccination has been combined with chemotherapy. Clinical trials have been conducted. There have been many failures but a selection of those currently in progress is presented. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: An overview of various types of personalized cancer vaccines, their mechanism of action and current status of development. Causes of failure of clinical trials and concepts of an ideal personalized cancer vaccine are presented. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A number of approaches are available for personalized cancer vaccines with variable degree of success. There are several challenges and needs for refinement of methods but it remains a promising area of cancer therapy.",

Clinical follow-up was possible in 29 RIF patients, in whom pET was performed, resulting in 51.7% PR and 33.9% IR. The IRs and PRs in the 6 months after the biopsy showed that pregnancy was not related to the local injury. Twenty-two RIF patients (25.9%) were NR, and in 15 of them a second ERA validated a displacement of the window of implantation (WOI). In eight of them, pET was performed on the day designated by the ERA, resulting in 50.0% PR and 38.5% IR. These results should be considered as preliminary. Conclusion(s): There is an increased percentage of WOI displacement in RIF patients compared with comparison group patients, leading to the concept of pET as a therapeutic strategy. Rescue of NR patients by pET in a displaced WOI results in similar PR and IR. \u00a9 2013 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",

        "abstract": "Food has societal, economic, medical and ethical implications, being fundamental for life. It plays an important role also in sports medicine, since a healthy diet is an important part of an athlete's training. Nutrigenomics and nutriproteomics are emerging as a result of a convergence of nutritional, genomics and proteomics knowledge strands in the postgenomics era. These fields of inquiry present an opportunity for the design of customized diets potentially able to counterbalance the extant obesity epidemic and remedy metabolic diseases, among others. They are noteworthy for sport medicine as well since they could provide athletes with crucial information for personalized training and nutrition, in order to achieve the best results possible and express one's own potential. But they could also be used as a form of personalized doping, thus constituting an advancement of \"classical nutrition-based doping\" (i.e., the use of nutraceuticals, stimulants and supplements). However, nutrigenomics (or nutriproteomics)-based nutritional doping is different from the first-generation doping because it is specifically tailored to the genomics and proteomics makeup of the athlete, although their effectiveness remain to be discerned in future systematic studies. Against this scientific background, ethical issues of nutrigenomics and nutriproteomics are discussed in the present paper with emphasis on the current limitations and the dizzying potentials of the omics data-intensive research for science and society. Additionally, I discuss the need to communicate uncertainty as a fundamental construct and intrinsic part of postgenomics personalized medicine, not to forget the gaps regarding the lack of adequate governance, and issues over providing a proper nutritional education to athletes as onus of the international sports organizations. \u00a9 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",

While there is extensive literature and debate about the various national and international laws and policies related to genomic research in general, most discussions focus on developed and high-income countries. Genomic research, however, is a global endeavor requiring enrollment, data-sharing, and data-storage policies that involve socially, economically, and ethnically diverse populations. On one hand, the translation of genomic medicine into personalized clinical care will fail globally if as many different populations as possible are not adequately represented at the research stage. On the other, future internationally sponsored genomic research projects that could translate into personalized medicine applications will be in jeopardy in communities where genomic researchers neglect to consider local laws, beliefs, and needs. This paper discusses the opportunities and challenges for investigators and research institutions seeking to conduct genomic research in Nigeria. Specifically, we highlight the potential role of Nigerian laws, such as Nigeria's National Code of Health Research Ethics and the role of local bodies, such as Community Advisory Committees, in promoting genomic research approaches that are appropriate for the local environment. This article thus contributes to a growing body of literature on global bioethics and personalized medicine in resource-limited settings. \u00a9 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",

Contrary to clinical practices that can be carefully planned according to clinical needs, heterogeneity and uncontrollability is the essence of humans in carrying out health studies. Full characterization of consistent phenotypes that define the general population is the basis to individual difference normalization in personalized medicine. Self-claimed normal status may not represent health because asymptomatic subjects may carry chronic diseases at their early stage, such as cancer, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Currently, treatments for non-communicable chronic diseases (NCD) are implemented after disease onset, which is a very much delayed approach from the perspective of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM). A NCD pandemic will develop and be accompanied by increased global economic burden for healthcare systems throughout both developed and developing countries. This paper examples the characterization of the suboptimal health status (SHS) which represents a new PPPM challenge in a population with ambiguous health complaints such as general weakness, unexplained medical syndrome (UMS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) and chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS).\\n\\nMETHODS: We applied clinical informatic approaches and developed a questionnaire-suboptimal health status questionnaire-25 (SHSQ-25) for measuring SHS. The validity and reliability of this approach were evaluated in a small pilot study and then in a cross-sectional study of 3,405 participants in China.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found a correlation between SHS and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among men, and a correlation between SHS and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol among women.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The SHSQ-25 is a self-rated questionnaire of perceived health complaints, which can be used as a new instrument for PPPM. An ongoing longitudinal SHS cohort survey (China Sub-optimal Health Cohort Study, COACS) consisting of 50,000 participants will provide a powerful health trial to use SHSQ-25 for its application to PPPM through patient stratification and therapy monitoring using innovative technologies of predictive diagnostics and prognosis: an effort of paradigm shift from reactive to predictive medicine.",

It is a major cause of death worldwide and results in the widespread use of antibiotics and substantial health care costs. In a vicious circle, sepsis treatment promotes the emergence of highly virulent and resistant pathogens and devastating nosocomial infections. Sepsis is a heterogeneous disease affecting many people worldwide. Because individual patients have different inflammatory responses and unique profiles of immune activation against pathogens, the most effective way to advance the treatment of sepsis is probably through a tailored approach. The advent of high-throughput technologies and the remarkable progress in the field of bioinformatics has allowed the subclassification of many pathological conditions. This has potential to provide better understanding of life-threatening infections in people. The study of host factors, however, needs to be integrated with studies on bacterial signaling in both symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. Sepsis is certainly the sum of multiple host-microbial interactions and the metagenome should be extensively investigated. Personalized medicine is probably the only strategy able to deconstruct and reassemble our knowledge about sepsis, and its use should allow us to understand and manipulate sepsis as a wide, interconnected phenomenon with myriad variables and peculiarities. In this study, the recent advances in this area, the major challenges that remain, and the reasons why the septic patient should be approached as a superorganism are discussed.",

This is partially because of varying disease manifestation, but polymorphic genes affecting drug metabolization substantially contribute. This review deals with pharmacogenetic (PGx) factors underlying interindividual differences of treatment response in sarcoidosis regarding personalized approach to patient management. Recent findings No firm evidence is available for introducing genotyping metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters (Cytochrome P450, TPMT, ABCB1 and so on) despite drugs they target (azathioprine and methotrexate) are used in sarcoidosis. Variation in TNFA gene, which was associated with response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (infliximab and adalimumab), is in line with plausible pathomechanisms; however, clinical utility should be confirmed. No PGx data have been yet reported in sarcoidosis for other biologicals (ustekinumab and rituximab). Extending to pharmacogenomics, further possibility for predicting sarcoidosis treatment response is represented by molecular (mRNA and miRNA) profiling at (post)transcriptional level. Summary Before PGx tests predicting treatment response are clinically utilized, information on genetic variation should be included in ongoing/new clinical trials, design of which should reflect needs to address relevance of testing gene variants either alone or in combination with other, that is genomic biomarkers. Attention must also be paid to predictors of adverse drug reactions, and possible ethnic or sex differences in individual treatment response should not be neglected. With this future complex information, we will be able to nominate genetic/genomic markers to provide additional level of guidance for selecting appropriate medication, drug combination(s) and dosage.",

Its natural history has changed in recent years with the advent of disease-modifying drugs, which have been available since the early 1990s. The increasing number of first-line and second-line treatment options, together with the variable course of the disease and patient lifestyles and expectations, makes the therapeutic decision a real challenge. The aim of this review is to give a comprehensive overview of the main present and some future drugs for relapsing-remitting MS, including risk-benefit considerations, to enable readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the risk-benefit assessment of personalized treatment strategies, taking into account not only treatment-related but also disease-related risks. We performed a Medline literature search to identify studies on the treatment of MS with risk stratification and risk-benefit considerations. We focused our attention on studies of disease-modifying, immunomodulating, and immunosuppressive drugs, including monoclonal antibodies. Here we offer personal considerations, stemming from long-term experience in the treatment of MS and thorough discussions with other neurologists closely involved in the care of patients with the disease. MS specialists need to know not only the specific risks and benefits of single drugs, but also about drug interactions, either in simultaneous or serial combination therapy, and patient comorbidities, preferences, and fears. This has to be put into perspective, considering also the risks of untreated disease in patients with different clinical and radiological characteristics. There is no single best treatment strategy, but therapy has to be tailored to the patient. This is a time-consuming task, rich in complexity, and influenced by the attitude towards risk on the parts of both the patient and the clinical team. The broader the MS drug market becomes, the harder it will be for the clinician to help the patient decide which therapeutic strategy to opt for. \u00a9 2013 Lugaresi et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In the last decades, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) has become a real alternative in the treatment of unresectable hepatic cancers. In practice, the activity prescription is limited by the irradiation of organs at risk (OAR), such as the lungs and nontumoral liver (NTL). Its clinical implementation is therefore highly dependent on dosimetry. In that context, a 3-dimensional personalized dosimetry technique-personalized Monte Carlo dosimetry (PMCD)-based on patient-specific data and Monte Carlo calculations was developed and evaluated retrospectively on clinical data.\\n\\nMETHODS: The PMCD method was evaluated with data from technetium human albumin macroaggregates ((99m)Tc-MAA) evaluations of 10 patients treated for hepatic metastases. Region-of-interest outlines were drawn on CT images to create patient-specific voxel phantoms using the OEDIPE software. Normalized 3-dimensional matrices of cumulated activity were generated from (99m)Tc-SPECT data. Absorbed doses at the voxel scale were then obtained with the MCNPX Monte Carlo code. The maximum-injectable activity (MIA) for tolerance criteria based on either OAR mean absorbed doses (Dmean) or OAR dose-volume histograms (DVHs) was determined using OEDIPE. Those MIAs were compared with the one recommended by the partition model (PM) with Dmean tolerance criteria. Finally, OEDIPE was used to evaluate the absorbed doses delivered if those activities were injected to the patient and to generate the corresponding isodose curves and DVHs.\\n\\nRESULTS: The MIA recommended using Dmean tolerance criteria is, in average, 27% higher with the PMCD method than with the PM. If tolerance criteria based on DVHs are used along with the PMCD, an increase of at least 40% of the MIA is conceivable, compared with the PM. For MIAs calculated with the PMCD, Dmean delivered to tumoral liver (TL) ranged from 19.5 to 118 Gy for Dmean tolerance criteria whereas they ranged from 26.6 to 918 Gy with DVH tolerance criteria. Thus, using the PMCD method, which accounts for fixation heterogeneities, higher doses can be delivered to TL. Finally, absorbed doses to the lungs are not the limiting criterion for activity prescription. However, Dmean to the lungs can reach 15.0 Gy.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Besides its feasibility and applicability in clinical routine, the interest for treatment optimization of a personalized Monte Carlo dosimetry in the context of SIRT was confirmed in this study.",

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor, this inter-tumoral heterogeneity is further complicated by intra-tumoral heterogeneity within the tumor. This suggests that for personalized therapy to work for GBMs, pharmacologic agents would not only be tailored to target the differences from patient to patient but also the clonal diversity within each patient's tumor.

The identification of several genes related to heredity, oncology and infectious diseases lead to the detection of genetic polymorphisms that are involved not only in different clinical progression of these diseases but also in variations in treatment response. Currently, it is possible to detect these polymorphisms using several methodologies: detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction methods; nucleic acid microarray detection; and nucleic acid sequencing with automatized DNA sequencers using Sanger-derived methods and new generation sequencing. Personalized medicine assays are directed towards detecting genetic variations that alter interactions of drugs with targets or the metabolic pathways of drugs (upstream and downstream) and can be utilized for the selection of drug formulations and detect different immunogenicities of the drug. Personalized medicine applications have already been described in different areas of Medicine and allow specific treatment approaches to be applied to each patient and pathology according to the results of these assays. The application of such a protocol demands an increasing interaction between the clinical laboratory and the clinical staff. For its implementation, a coordinated team composed of basic researchers and physicians highly specialized in their areas supported by a highly specialized team of clinical analysts particularly trained in molecular biology assays is necessary.",

The Republic of Malawi is located in Southeast of Africa and its population is made up of eight major native ethnic groups (Chewa or Nyanja, Tumbuka, Yao, Lhomwe, Sena, Tonga, Ngoni and Ngonde) as well as Asians and Europeans. We herein identify a series of gene-centric knowledge gaps that need to be addressed urgently to advance population pharmacogenomics in Malawi. We also underscore the need for research attention and investment in personalized genomics for this African country. The genetic data obtained from the few previous studies show that frequencies of polymorphism in different genes among Malawians are not similar to other African populations, indicating again the need for population specific genomics research across Africa, if the goal of global personalized medicine is going to be achieved equitably for all populations of the world. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",

        "abstract": "Sequencing the human genome, more than a decade ago, initiated the genomics era and the promise of truly personalized medicine. However, much is still unknown about the genetic factors that affect drug efficacy and toxicity, and there are currently very few clinically useful pharmacogenetic tests available. Of these, even fewer are potentially of benefit to developing countries in Africa because pharmacogenetic screening tests are often not applicable to African populations with their unique genetic profiles. Yet, pharmacogenetic tests that accurately predict drug response and toxicity can have a major impact on efficient and effective healthcare in Africa, where the burden of disease is greatest. HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are responsible for approximately 2.5 million deaths in Africa annually, and improving medical care for just these three infectious diseases would save millions of lives. A number of potential biomarkers have been reported that purportedly influence the efficacy and/or toxicity of antiretroviral, antimalarial, and antituberculosis drugs, but more research is required to completely understand the pharmacogenetic applications associated with these treatments. Another 2 million people, however, are dying of preventable and easily curable diseases, such as diarrhoeal and lower respiratory tract diseases. Although pharmacogenetics can play a pivotal role in combating the disease and therapeutic burden in Africa in the future, a multifaceted approach is required to provide effective, affordable and personalized healthcare while also addressing the extreme poverty and other related problems of the people in Africa. \u00a9 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and acute (i.e., within 72 hrs) safety of three levels of systolic blood pressure reduction in subjects with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage treated within 6 hrs after symptom onset. DESIGN: A traditional phase I, dose-escalation, multicenter prospective study. SETTINGS: Emergency departments and intensive care units. PATIENTS: Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage with elevated systolic blood pressure > or = 170 mm Hg who present to the emergency department within 6 hrs of symptom onset. INTERVENTION: Intravenous nicardipine to reduce systolic blood pressure to a target of: (1) 170 to 200 mm Hg in the first cohort of patients; (2) 140 to 170 mm Hg in the second cohort; and (3) 110 to 140 mm Hg in the third cohort. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes of interest were: (1) treatment feasibility (achieving and maintaining the systolic blood pressure goals for 18-24 hrs); (2) neurologic deterioration within 24 hrs; and (3) serious adverse events within 72 hrs. Safety stopping rules based on neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were prespecified and approved by an NIH-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which provided oversight on subject safety. Each subject was followed-up for 3 months to preliminarily assess mortality and the clinical outcomes. A total of 18, 20, and 22 patients were enrolled in the respective three tiers of systolic blood pressure treatment goals. Overall, 9 of 60 patients had treatment failures (all in the last tier). A total of seven subjects with neurologic deterioration were observed: one (6%), two (10%), and four (18%) in tier one, two, and three, respectively. Serious adverse events were observed in one subject (5%) in tier two and in three subjects (14%) in tier three. However, the safety stopping rule was not activated in any of the tiers. Three (17%), two (10%), and five (23%) subjects in tiers one, two, and three, respectively, died within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The observed proportions of neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were below the prespecified safety thresholds, and the 3-month mortality rate was lower than expected in all systolic blood pressure tiers. The results form the basis of a larger randomized trial addressing the efficacy of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.",

Existing methods manage portraits based on either explicit objectives, e.g., a specified person or event, or aesthetics, i.e., the aesthetic quality of portraits. This paper presents a novel system for personalized portraits ranking. First, four kinds of personalized features, i.e., composition, clothing style, affection and social relationship are proposed to quantify users' intent. Then, example-based and sketch-based user interfaces (UI) are developed, which are capable of capturing users' personal intent hardly described by queries or aesthetics. Finally, portraits ranking is implemented by combing these features together with the developed user interfaces. Experimental results show that the system performs well in providing personalized preferences and the proposed features are effective for portraits ranking. From the user study, our system gets promising results.",

This information underlies a new healthcare strategy focused on prevention and early intervention, rather than reaction to advanced stages of disease. Such a strategy can delay disease onset or minimize symptom severity. The molecular foundations that enable personalized medicine include detection of variation in nucleotide sequence of genes and in characteristic patterns of gene expression, proteins and metabolites. Genetic and molecular patterns are correlated with disease manifestations, drug responses, treatment prognosis, or prediction of predisposition to future disease states. However, the uncertainties for personalized medicine are considerable, including economic, ethical, legal, and societal questions. Although much of its promise remains unproven to date, the foundations of personalized medicine appear solid and evidence is accumulating rapidly pointing to its growing importance in healthcare (Fig. 1).",

More than 2,000 mutations have been described, and certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to have a large impact on CYP activity. Therefore, CYPs play an important role in inter-individual drug response and their genetic variability should be factored into personalized medicine. To identify the most relevant polymorphisms in human CYPs, a text mining approach was used. We investigated their frequencies in different ethnic groups, the number of drugs that are metabolized by each CYP, the impact of CYP SNPs, as well as CYP expression patterns in different tissues. The most important polymorphic CYPs were found to be 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. Thirty-four common allele variants in Caucasians led to altered enzyme activity. To compare the relevant Caucasian SNPs with those of other ethnicities a search in 1,000 individual genomes was undertaken. We found 199 non-synonymous SNPs with frequencies over one percent in the 1,000 genomes, many of them not described so far. With knowledge of frequent mutations and their impact on CYP activities, it may be possible to predict patient response to certain drugs, as well as adverse side effects. With improved availability of genotyping, our data may provide a resource for an understanding of the effects of specific SNPs in CYPs, enabling the selection of a more personalized treatment regimen.",

We also report the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients. METHODS: We prospectively randomized children 9 to 17 years of age to one of four treatment groups: 1) home-based pencil push-ups, 2) home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy and pencil push-ups, 3) office-based vergence/accommodative therapy with home reinforcement, 4) office-based placebo therapy. Outcome data on the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) score (primary outcome), near point of convergence (NPC), and positive fusional vergence were collected after 12 weeks of active treatment and again at 6 and 12 months posttreatment. RESULTS: The CITT enrolled 221 children with symptomatic CI with a mean age of 12.0 years (SD = +2.3). The clinical profile of the cohort at baseline was 9Delta exophoria at near (+/- 4.4) and 2Delta exophoria (+/-2.8) at distance, CISS score = 30 (+/-9.0), NPC = 14 cm (+/- 7.5), and near positive fusional vergence break = 13 Delta (+/- 4.6). There were no statistically significant nor clinically relevant differences between treatment groups with respect to baseline characteristics (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hallmark features of the study design include formal definitions of conditions and outcomes, standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols, a placebo treatment arm, masked outcome examinations, and the CISS score outcome measure. The baseline data reported herein define the clinical profile of those enrolled into the CITT.",

We conducted a phase II study to explore the feasibility of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV), in which peptides are selected and administered based on the pre-existing host immunity before vaccination, as a third or more line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients who failed two or more regimens. Among 57 patients enrolled, 23 or 16 patients received PPV with chemotherapy or targeted therapy, respectively, whereas 18 patients received PPV alone. A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides showing higher peptide-specific IgG responses in pre-vaccination plasma were selected from 31 pooled peptide candidates applicable for patients with HLA-A2, -A24, -A3 supertypes, and/or -A26, followed by subcutaneous administration. No severe adverse events related to PPV were observed. Median survival time was 692, 468, or 226 days in the group of PPV/chemotherapy, PPV/targeted therapy, or PPV alone, respectively. CTL responses to the vaccinated peptides became detectable after vaccination in 58, 50, or 42% of patients in each of these three groups, respectively. In contrast, peptide-specific IgG responses after vaccination augmented in 55, 75, or 62% of patients in each of these groups, respectively. These results suggest the feasibility of PPV for heavily treated advanced NSCLC patients from the view of both immunological responses and safety.

        "abstract": "The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane \u00d7 receptor (PXR) are activated by a variety of endogenous and exogenous ligands, such as steroid hormones, bile acids, pharmaceuticals, and environmental, dietary, and occupational chemicals. In turn, they induce phase I-III detoxification enzymes and transporters that help eliminate these chemicals. Because many of the chemicals that activate CAR and PXR are environmentally-relevant (dietary and anthropogenic), studies need to address whether these chemicals or mixtures of these chemicals may increase the susceptibility to adverse drug interactions. In addition, CAR and PXR are involved in hepatic proliferation, intermediary metabolism, and protection from cholestasis. Therefore, activation of CAR and PXR may have a wide variety of implications for personalized medicine through physiological effects on metabolism and cell proliferation; some beneficial and others adverse. Identifying the chemicals that activate these promiscuous nuclear receptors and understanding how these chemicals may act in concert will help us predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs), predict cholestasis and steatosis, and regulate intermediary metabolism. This review summarizes the available data on CAR and PXR, including the environmental chemicals that activate these receptors, the genes they control, and the physiological processes that are perturbed or depend on CAR and PXR action. This knowledge contributes to a foundation that will be necessary to discern interindividual differences in the downstream biological pathways regulated by these key nuclear receptors.",

        "abstract": "Although target-based approach has yielded novel drugs in many therapeutic fields, this approach remains suboptimal and slows the pace of innovations for drug discovery in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This is because the target identification requires a hierarchical integration from in vitro cellular and functional tissue studies to animal models that reasonably predict drug effects in humans. Because the majority of CNS drugs were discovered empirically to date, the precise target site(s) for many of them remain unknown or uncertain, even after years of clinical and commercial use. This paper presents a critical review and synthesis of the emerging proteomics applications for drug target discovery with an emphasis on defining the early molecular mechanisms by which (hitherto empirically discovered) drugs or novel neurotrophic factors initiate cellular change toward physiological effects with therapeutic ramifications. Pharmacoproteomics methodology provides important qualitative information on post-translational modifications to each protein as well as quantitative data on protein expression patterns in response to a given pharmaceutical stimulus. This information is particularly important because it provides data on early cellular events such as the stimulus and signaling cascades triggered independently of protein neosynthesis. Pharmacoproteomics is still in its infancy but offers substantial promise in personalized medicine in addition to the pharmacogenomics methodologies.  2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To contribute to the theoretical literature on personalized medicine, analyzing and integrating in an economic model, the decision a health authority faces when it must decide on the implementation of personalized medicine in a context of uncertainty. METHODS: We carry out a stylized model to analyze the decision health authorities face when they do not have perfect information about the best treatment for a population of patients with a given disease. The health authorities decide whether to use a test to match patients with treatments (personalized medicine) to maximize health outcomes. Our model characterizes the situations under which personalized medicine dominates the alternative option of business-as-usual (treatment without previous test). We apply the model to the KRAS test for colorectal cancer, the PCA3 test for prostate cancer and the PCR test for the X-fragile syndrome, to illustrate how the parameters and variables of the model interact. RESULTS: Implementation of personalized medicine requires, as a necessary condition, having some tests with high discriminatory power. This is not a sufficient condition and expected health outcomes must be taken into account to make a decision. When the specificity and the sensitivity of the test are low, the health authority prefers to apply a treatment to all patients without using the test. When both characteristic of the test are high, the health authorities prefer to personalize the treatments when expected health outcomes are better than those under the standard treatment. When we applied the model to the three aforementioned tests, the results illustrate how decisions are adopted in real world. CONCLUSIONS: Although promising, the use of personalized medicine is still under scrutiny as there are important issues demanding a response. Personalized medicine may have an impact in the drug development processes, and contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery. Nevertheless, more accurate statistical and economic information related to tests results and treatment costs as well as additional medical information on the efficacy of the treatments are needed to adopt decisions that incorporate economic rationality.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Being able to visualize multivariate biological treatment effects can be insightful. However the axes in visualizations are often solely defined by variation and thus have no biological meaning. This makes the effects of treatment difficult to interpret.\\n\\nMETHODS: A statistical visualization method is presented, which analyses and visualizes the effects of treatment in individual subjects. The visualization is based on predefined biological processes as determined by systems-biological datasets (metabolomics proteomics and transcriptomics). This allows one to evaluate biological effects depending on shifts of either groups or subjects in the space predefined by the axes, which illustrate specific biological processes. We built validated multivariate models for each axis to represent several biological processes. In this space each subject has his or her own score on each axis/process, indicating to which extent the treatment affects the related process.\\n\\nRESULTS: The health space model was applied to visualize the effects of a nutritional intervention, with the goal of applying diet to improve health. The model was therefore named the 'health space' model. The 36 study subjects received a 5-week dietary intervention containing several anti-inflammatory ingredients. Plasma concentrations of 79 proteins and 145 metabolites were quantified prior to and after treatment. The principal processes modulated by the intervention were oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolism. These processes formed the axes of the 'health space'. The approach distinguished the treated and untreated groups, as well as two different response subgroups. One subgroup reacted mainly by modulating its metabolic stress profile, while a second subgroup showed a specific inflammatory and oxidative response to treatment.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The 'health space' model allows visualization of multiple results and to interpret them. The model presents treatment group effects, subgroups and individual responses.",

These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-\u03bb-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type.",

This review provides an overview of the recent advances that have led to this transition, lists the advantages and disadvantages of both strategies, candidate genes and WGA, and discusses their applicability. Another area in need of development is the standards to validate the pharmacogenetics associations observed to date. To this end, pharmacogenetics studies can also be classified as exploratory or confirmatory, independent from the design strategy used. This review discusses the importance of both types of study, exploratory and confirmatory, in ongoing efforts to replicate significant associations, and in order to provide adequate evidence for the introduction of pharmacogenetics tests in clinical practice. These different strategies or objectives (candidate genes versus WGA; exploratory versus confirmatory) are valid approaches to achieve the ultimate goal of pharmacogenetics, personalized medicine. Additionally, these nuanced differences in pharmacogenetics scientific practice must be kept in mind to ensure the appropriate evaluation of scientific merit in pharmacogenetics association studies, and their appropriate differentiation from the genetic studies concerning the disease susceptibility phenotypes. 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd",

Till 2009, even at TMH nearly one-third of patients refused or abandoned treatment. The purpose of this study is to find the predictors of TR &A, and analyze the impact of personalized psycho-social & economic support which has been organized since 2009. Methods: All children with newly diagnosed cancer up-to 15 years, registered at TMH from January 2010 to December 2011 were studied for rates of TR &A and predictive demographic factors were assessed. In addition, all such families of 2011 were interviewed with a structured questionnaire to evaluate reasons for TR &A. Furthermore, the impact of an organized team of social workers, nutritionists, data managers for patient tracking, and providing incremental psychosocial,emotional, financial and transfusion support to all families was examined. Results: The total number of patients with TR &A fell to 10.4% (118/1131) in 2010 (64/ 1222) in 2011. The key demographic factors associated with TR & A were younger age of child (<5 years), female gender, paternal as well as maternal illiteracy and poor socioeconomic status. There was no impact of disease type or prognosis, treatment duration or intensity and language of communication. Of the 64 families with TR &A in 2011 contacted, 30 refused to participate or could not be contacted. The dominant reasons cited by those interviewed were financial constraints (26%), preference for complimentary & alternative medicine (CAM; 26%), inadequate reassurance by health staff regarding curability (18%), need to travel great distance or accommodation problems (9%), anxiety regarding treatment related toxicity (9%), gender bias (9%), and crowded treatment center (3%). Conclusion: Socioeconomic factors do play a major role in TR &A. Additional important factors are belief in CAM, distance from centre, false belief of incurability of cancer or toxicity with allopathy. Establishment of a dedicated psycho-social economic support group can reduce TR &A in a resource limited setting and help improve outcomes.",

Currently there is special focus on research on how our food influences us and might cause discomfort or even symptoms of disease, but also the fact that several food intolerances are caused by genetic alterations. The strong interest expressed by certain segments of the general population for predictive and preventive diagnostic testing in relation to diet and ways in which this can improve overall health led to a fast growing market of nutrigenetic based tests. This puts pressures and challenges on governments and insurers for how best to reimburse new genetic tests. These discussions are best informed by a sound understanding of nutrigenetics science and technology, its promises and challenges, which are addressed in this paper. For example, some of the most common food intolerances caused by genetic variations are lactose intolerance, inherited fructose intolerance, congenital sucrase isomaltase deficiency (sucrose intolerance), celiac disease, glucose-6-phosphate deficiency (favism), alcohol intolerance and hemochromatosis. The increasing understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with these conditions is stimulating the development of a broad range of diagnostics allowing any person with adequate resources to have their genetic predispositions determined. However, many of the currently available tests cover only one of the above mentioned diseases or a small set of responsible mutations, which is in strong contrast to the evolution of medicine towards a more holistic approach as, for example, P4 medicine. Additionally, available tests are often not based on evidence or other guidelines for genetic test development as recommended by the ACCE evidentiary framework. In this paper we discuss the most common nutrigenetic diseases and their potential and demonstrated impacts on public health, as well as ways to devise personalized diet informed by human genomics variation in the future. \u00a9 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",

Most of the previous studies in this category only consider a single relationship type, such as friendships in a social network. In many scenarios, the entity recommendation problem exists in a heterogeneous information network environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve the recommendation quality. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. Specifically, we propose to combine heterogeneous relationship information for each user differently and aim to provide high-quality personalized recommendation results using user implicit feedback data and personalized recommendation models. In order to take full advantage of the relationship heterogeneity in information networks, we first introduce meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different types of paths. We then define recommendation models at both global and personalized levels and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the proposed models. Empirical studies show that our approaches outperform several widely employed or the state-of-the-art entity recommendation techniques. \u00a9 2014 ACM.",

The potential chilling effects of GD both in the clinical and research settings have prompted the adoption of a myriad of laws and moratoria on access to genetic data in Europe and the United States. Recent studies in Canada, Australia and Germany concerning patients and family members at-risk for Huntington's disease have raised concerns about GD and life insurance. However, broader empirical evidence on the occurrence of GD (ex. involving complex genetic disorders in the context of personalized medicine) remains scarce. This study identifies the information that Canadian life insurers request in their primary proposal forms. 21 forms from different insurers, available online, were assessed to determine 1) whether insurers are explicitly or specifically requesting genetic information from applicants, 2) whether insurers are using open-ended questions in a way that may compel the broad disclosure of personal information, and 3) what type of authorization is requested from applicants to enable insurers to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted on the form. Our findings show that Canadian life insurers do not explicitly request that applicants disclose their genetic test results on insurance questionnaires. However, their use of broad terminology and open questions, provide them access to a wealth of medical information (including genetic test results) in addition to family history of diseases. Both the breadth of information currently being collected through their proposal forms and the lack of standardization across insurance groups raise concerns about the equity, transparency and overall coherence of the process. Although the findings have to be interpreted in the context of the inherent limitations of this type of study, they carry important consequences for the translation of personal- ized medicine which requires and generates a wealth of genomic information for patients. \u00a9 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",

That is why efforts to further PGx education in health professional schools have been initiated to reduce the gap that currently exists between research and practice. Because there is a current paucity of information regarding the status of PGx education in low and middle income countries (LMICs) in comparison to high income countries, the aim of our study was to evaluate this important gap using an online survey that we electronically sent to the relevant delegates of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) \"World Pharma 2010\" meeting (Copenhagen, July 2010). Respondents from 25 global institutions answered our survey, of which more than half had already incorporated PGx teaching into their curricula. Although PGx was an integral part of the World Pharma 2010 topics, only few PGx abstracts from LMICs were presented when compared to high income countries: 37 abstracts from 18 high income countries compared to 20 from 16 LMICs (Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Lebanon, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, and Uganda). PGx education was mainly introduced as part of the already existing pharmacology courses, was dedicated an average of 2-4 hours of teaching, and was mainly delivered through lectures and seminars. Even though these findings are on par with the international guidelines that outline the minimal requirements of PGx education in health professional schools, further strategic planning for PGx education is no doubt crucial which can be informed by our findings reported herein. This research paper presents a discussion and concrete ways forward for teaching PGx for global personalized medicine in LMICS and beyond. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides one of the first empirical insights into the current status of PGx teaching in LMICs. \u00a9 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",

One example is gene expression profiling (gep) tests, which estimate recurrence risk to inform chemotherapy decisions in breast cancer. Recently, gep tests were publicly funded in Ontario. We explored the perceived utility of gep tests, focusing on the factors influencing their use and value in treatment decision-making by patients and oncologists.\\n\\nMETHODS: We conducted interviews with oncologists (n = 14) and interviews and a focus group with early-stage breast cancer patients (n = 28) who underwent gep testing. Both groups were recruited through oncology clinics in Ontario. Data were analyzed using the content analysis and constant comparison techniques.\\n\\nRESULTS: Narratives from patients and oncologists provided insights into various factors facilitating and restricting access to gep. First, oncologists are positioned as gatekeepers of gep, providing access in medically appropriate cases. However, varying perceptions of appropriateness led to perceived inequities in access and negative impacts on the doctor-patient relationship. Second, media attention facilitated patient awareness of gep, but also complicated gatekeeping. Third, the dedicated administration attached to gep was burdensome and led to long waits for results and also to increased patient anxiety and delayed treatment. Collectively, because of barriers to access, those factors inadvertently heightened the perceived value of gep for patients relative to other prognostic indicators.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study delineates the factors facilitating and restricting access to gep, and highlights the roles of media and organization of services in the perceived value and utilization of gep. The results identify a need for administrative changes and practice guidelines to support streamlined and standardized use of gep tests.",

Patients and Methods: We used a multivariate prediction model to identify patients with a high risk of initiating statin therapy within 3 years. The model was used to target a study cohort most likely to benefit from preemptive PGx testing among the Mayo Clinic Biobank participants, with a recruitment goal of 1000 patients. We used a Cox proportional hazards model with variables selected through the Lasso shrinkage method. An operational CDS model was adapted to implement PGx rules within the EMR. Results: The prediction model included age, sex, race, and 6 chronic diseases categorized by the Clinical Classifications Software for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (dyslipidemia, diabetes, peripheral atherosclerosis, disease of the blood-forming organs, coronary atherosclerosis and other heart diseases, and hypertension). Of the 2000 Biobank participants invited, 1013 (51%) provided blood samples, 256 (13%) declined participation, 555 (28%) did not respond, and 176 (9%) consented but did not provide a blood sample within the recruitment window (October 4, 2012, through March 20, 2013). Preemptive PGx testing included CYP2D6 genotyping and targeted sequencing of 84 PGx genes. Synchronous real-time CDS was integrated into the EMR and flagged potential patient-specific drug-gene interactions and provided therapeutic guidance. Conclusion: This translational project provides an opportunity to begin to evaluate the impact of preemptive sequencing and EMR-driven genome-guided therapy. These interventions will improve understanding and implementation of genomic data in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "In a recent issue of PLOSone Depner et al. [1] reported an excellent study on omega-3 fatty acid-induced changes in lipid metabolomics that may be involved in attenuating western diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A western diet, which is typically rich in saturated and trans fats, that leads to fat accumulation in the liver. This condition resembles alcoholic fatty liver disease; however, it progresses in the absence of any alcohol intake and is known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [2]. In most individuals, the liver is devoid of any symptoms or problems that will only culminate in mild steatosis. However, in some cases, especially individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome, the fat accumulation is accompanied with inflammation and causes NASH. If untreated, NASH worsens and causes fibrosis resulting in scarring of the liver. The pathophysiologic pathway of NAFLD is not clearly elucidated. Day and James [3] in 1998 proposed the \u201ctwo-hit phenomenon,\u201d where the \u201cfirst hit\u201d consists of triglyceride (TG) depositions in hepatocytes causing cellular dysfunction and death (lipotoxicity). The hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance play a role in the first hit causing an alteration in uptake, synthesis, degradation, and secretion of free fatty acids leading to an accumulation of fat in hepatocytes, or steatosis [4,5]. Steatosis by itself is not detrimental, but the steatotic liver becomes more vulnerable to \u201csecond hits\u201d by inflammatory cytokines, endotoxins, and oxidative stress causing mitochondrial dysfunction, which ultimately results in hepatocyte injury and fibrosis [6]. NAFLD is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To date there is no standardized optimal treatment, although several approaches to treat NAFLD have been adopted, including weight reduction, limiting dietary carbohydrate intake, inhibiting fat absorption by sibtramine and orlistat, lowering lipid profile by statins, improving insulin sensitivity by Metformin and thioglitazone and reducing oxidative stress by vitamin E [7-9].",

They critically regulate the post-transcriptional activity of several key physiological and pathological cell processes including cancer. Through their transcriptional regulatory functions, miRNAs control tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. The expression of miRNAs is altered in malignancies. It could be either upregulated or downregulated depending upon the role of a particular miRNA in the pathogenetic development of the tumor. The upregulated miRNAs exert an 'oncogenic' effect leading to tumor proliferation and metastasis. The downregulated miRNAs have 'tumor suppressor' effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs have a role in the early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment outcome assessment of cancers. Every tumor has specific miRNA alterations, i.e. some are overexpressed and others are downregulated. These altered miRNAs can be used as a tumor-specific 'signature' for potential clinical use in improving the accuracy of diagnosis, determining prognosis and as therapeutic targets for therapy. Specific miRNAs can be targeted using oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the altered miRNAs. These are referred to as 'antagomirs'. Depending upon the miRNA alterations in the tumor of an individual patient, one could design targeted therapies for personalized medicine in patients. Hence, miRNAs have an immense role in personalized cancer therapy.",

These studies also identify a substantial probability of partial response and of relapse, which might be addressed by more intensive, longer-term treatments. METHOD: Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) is a multicenter, randomized, masked effectiveness trial designed to evaluate the short-term (12-week) and long-term (36-week) effectiveness of four treatments for adolescents with MDD: fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, their combination, and, acutely, pill placebo. A volunteer sample of 432 subjects aged 12-17 years (inclusive) with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD who are broadly representative of patients seen in clinical practice will enter the study. The primary dependent measures rated blindly by an independent evaluator are the Children's Depression Rating Scale and, for responder analysis, a dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score. Consistent with an intent-to-treat analysis, all patients, regardless of treatment status, return for all scheduled assessments. RESULTS: This report describes the design of the trial, the rationale for the design choices made, and the methods used to carry out the trial. CONCLUSION: When completed, TADS will improve our understanding of how best to initiate treatment for adolescents with MDD.",

Our quantitative image reconstruction algorithm includes corrections for attenuation, resolution degradations and scatter as well as a window-based compensation for contamination. The procedure has been validated using four phantom experiments containing an 18\u00a0ml cylindrical source (82-93 MBq of (188)Re activity) simulating a liver tumor. In addition, we applied our approach to post-therapy SPECT studies of ten patients with progressive primary or metastatic liver carcinomas. Our quantitative algorithm accurately (within 9%) recovered (188)Re activity from four phantom experiments. In addition, for two patients that received three scans, deviations remained consistent between the measured and the reconstructed activities that were determined from studies with differing severity of the dead-time effect. The analysis of absorbed doses for patient studies allowed us to hypothesize that D90 (the minimum dose received by 90% of the tumor volume) may be a reliable metric relating therapy outcomes to the calculated doses. Among several considered metrics, only D90 showed statistically significant correlation with the overall survival.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To assess individual volumetric tumor regression pattern in cervical cancer during therapy using serial four-dimensional MRI and to define the regression parameters' prognostic value validated with local control and survival correlation. Methods and Materials: One hundred and fifteen patients with Stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer treated with radiation therapy (RT) underwent serial MRI before (MRI 1) and during RT, at 2-2.5 weeks (MRI 2, at 20-25 Gy), and at 4-5 weeks (MRI 3, at 40-50 Gy). Eighty patients had a fourth MRI 1-2 months post-RT. Mean follow-up was 5.3 years. Tumor volume was measured by MRI-based three-dimensional volumetry, and plotted as dose(time)/volume regression curves. Volume regression parameters were correlated with local control, disease-specific, and overall survival. Results: Residual tumor volume, slope, and area under the regression curve correlated significantly with local control and survival. Residual volumes \u226520% at 40-50 Gy were independently associated with inferior 5-year local control (53% vs. 97%, p <0.001) and disease-specific survival rates (50% vs. 72%, p = 0.009) than smaller volumes. Patients with post-RT residual volumes \u226510% had 0% local control and 17% disease-specific survival, compared with 91% and 72% for <10% volume (p <0.001). Conclusion: Using more accurate four-dimensional volumetric regression analysis, tumor response can now be directly translated into individual patients' outcome for clinical application. Our results define two temporal thresholds critically influencing local control and survival. In patients with \u226520% residual volume at 40-50 Gy and \u226510% post-RT, the risk for local failure and death are so high that aggressive intervention may be warranted. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and prevent vascular events, but their net effects in people at low risk of vascular events remain uncertain. METHODS: This meta-analysis included individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control (n=134537; mean LDL cholesterol difference 1.08 mmol/L; median follow-up 4.8 years) and five trials of more versus less statin (n=39612; difference 0.51 mmol/L; 5.1 years). Major vascular events were major coronary events (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death), strokes, or coronary revascularisations. Participants were separated into five categories of baseline 5-year major vascular event risk on control therapy (no statin or low-intensity statin) (<5%, >/=5% to <10%, >/=10% to <20%, >/=20% to <30%, >/=30%); in each, the rate ratio (RR) per 1.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction was estimated. FINDINGS: Reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77-0.81, per 1.0 mmol/L reduction), largely irrespective of age, sex, baseline LDL cholesterol or previous vascular disease, and of vascular and all-cause mortality. The proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories (RR per 1.0 mmol/L reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0.62 [99% CI 0.47-0.81], 0.69 [99% CI 0.60-0.79], 0.79 [99% CI 0.74-0.85], 0.81 [99% CI 0.77-0.86], and 0.79 [99% CI 0.74-0.84]; trend p=0.04), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events (RR 0.57, 99% CI 0.36-0.89, p=0.0012, and 0.61, 99% CI 0.50-0.74, p<0.0001) and in coronary revascularisations (RR 0.52, 99% CI 0.35-0.75, and 0.63, 99% CI 0.51-0.79; both p<0.0001). For stroke, the reduction in risk in participants with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10% (RR per 1.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0.76, 99% CI 0.61-0.95, p=0.0012) was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories (trend p=0.3). In participants without a history of vascular disease, statins reduced the risks of vascular (RR per 1.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.95) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97), and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline risk. There was no evidence that reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin increased cancer incidence (RR per 1.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.04), cancer mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.06), or other non-vascular mortality. INTERPRETATION: In individuals with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10%, each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 years. This benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of statin therapy. Under present guidelines, such individuals would not typically be regarded as suitable for LDL-lowering statin therapy. The present report suggests, therefore, that these guidelines might need to be reconsidered.

The review was updated until mid April 2013.\\n\\nRESULTS: Since the original description of pharmacometabonomics in 2006, 21 original publications and eight reviews have emerged, covering a broad range of applications from the prediction of PK to the prediction of drug metabolism, efficacy and safety in humans and animals.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Pharmacometabonomics promises to be an important new approach to the delivery of personalized medicine to improve both drug efficacy and safety for patients in the future. Pharmacometabonomics is particularly powerful as it is sensitive to both genetic and environmental factors such as diet, drug intake and most importantly, a person's microbiome. PGx is now over 50 years old and although it has not achieved as much as some hoped, it is starting to have important applications in personalized medicine. We predict that pharmacometabonomics will be equally important in the next few decades and will be both valuable in its own right and complementary to pharmacoproteomics and PGx.",

This study is designed to evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness of four treatments for adolescents with major depressive disorder: fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, their combination, and, acutely, pill placebo. This report describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample and addresses external validity. Participants are 439 adolescents, aged 12-17 years inclusively, with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of current major depressive disorder. Baseline data are summarized and compared with those from national samples and previous trials. The sample composition is 54.4% girls, 73.8% white, 12.5% African American, and 8.9% Hispanic. The mean Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score is 60.1 (SD = 10.4, range 45-98) with 86.0% experiencing their first major depressive episode. The most common concurrent diagnoses are generalized anxiety disorder (15.3%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (13.7%), oppositional defiant disorder (13.2%), social phobia (10.7%), and dysthymia (10.5%). Demographic results are consistent with data from national samples and large psychopharmacology trials involving depressed adolescents. The Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study provides a large, diverse, and representative sample of depressed adolescents that highlights the complexity of major depressive disorder in adolescents and provides a rich source for explicating the effects of moderator and mediator variables on baseline psychopathology and treatment outcome.

The aim of this paper is to emphasize the evolution of life sciences into a more predictive science, where the development of quantitative models is starting to take place. Personalized medicine is a consequence of such paradigm shift. To keep up with the change, the various actors within the health system must be trained in a completely different manner, focusing on the ability to work as part of a multidisciplinary team that includes medical doctors, nurses, engineers in medical imaging, and others who collect information from patients. In addition, these teams should include modelers that are able to integrate the flood of data into predictive and quantitative models.

As a result, the \"omics\" revolution boomed, giving birth to a new medicine named \"omics-based medicine\". Among the other \"omics\", proteomics has been widely used in medicine, since it can produce a more \"holistic\" overview of a disease and provide a \" constellation\" of possible specific markers, a molecular fingerprinting that defines the clinical condition of an individual. Endpoint of this comprehensive and detailed analysis is the \"diagnostic-omics\", i.e. the achievement of personalized diagnoses with obvious benefits for prevention and therapy and this goal can be reached only with a perfect integration between clinicians and proteomists. To impact on the possible key factors involved in the pathological processes, oligonucleotide-based knock-down strategies can be helpful. They exploit omics-derived molecular tools (antisense, siRNA, ribozymes, decoys, and aptamers) that can be used to inhibit, at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, the events leading to protein synthesis, thus decreasing its expression. The identification of the pivotal mechanisms involved in diseases using global, \"scenic\" approaches such as the \"omics\" ones, and the subsequent validation and detailed description of the processes by specific molecular tools, can result in a more preventive, predictive and personalized medicine.",

Perhaps the greatest challenge is obtaining the drugs predicted to be beneficial based on the genomic profile of a patient's tumour. A potential solution is creation of a national facilitated access programme and registry for off-label use of targeted anti-cancer drugs. Within such a programme, patients could receive the targeted agent matched to the genomic profile of their tumour. Physicians would receive guidance in interpretation of complex genomic tests and access to drugs. Pharmaceutical companies, payers and regulators would receive data on off-label drug and test use and clinical outcomes to inform their research and development plans and coverage decisions and to track real-world safety. Although recently launched prospective clinical trials will determine the true benefit of matching drugs to genomic alterations, the approach proposed here will facilitate delivery of personalized medicine services to participating patients while at the same time making observations that allow us to learn from each patient to inform clinical care and future research initiatives.",

        "abstract": "The personalization principle, one of the design principles of multimedia learning, states that people learn better from multimedia presentations when instructions are in a conversational style rather than a formal style, possibly due to learners' increased interest. This principle was shown to be robust in short interventions that could be completed within minutes or a few dozen minutes; however, complex digital simulations and games that support the acquisition of complex mental models usually take longer to complete. In this study, we investigate the personalization principle in a new context: in an interactive simulation on the topic of beer brewing, which lasts 2-3 h. Instructions were presented in the Czech language, either in a personalized style, where learners were addressed conversationally by \"their grandpa, an owner of the family brewery,\" or in a non-personalized, more formal style without the grandpa. In Experiment 1, 26 college students, who interacted with both simulation versions, expressed on average a preference for the personalized version of the simulation. However, some of them worried that personalization could distract them. In Experiment 2 with a between-subject design, the knowledge of 75 predominantly college students was tested by means of retention and transfer tests immediately after completing the simulation and also a month later. Contrary to most previous works, our results showed no difference between the personalized and non-personalized groups in learning achievement, despite the fact that learners who received the personalized treatment voluntarily spent about 20% more time on the simulation. We also applied various measures of the learner's affective state, including Flow Short Scale and PANAS, but - again - no between-group differences were observed. These results indicate that personalization is not always beneficial to learning, which raises important questions for future research. Additional findings suggest that the simulation, no matter the treatment type, was most beneficial to learners with high mathematical abilities and who play computer games frequently, and also to those who liked the simulation more. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our model incorporates the fact that firms engage in marginal cost-reducing activities after they decide whether to employ personalized pricing. When the ex ante cost difference between the firms is large, the less-efficient firm does not employ personalized pricing even when the fixed cost to do so is zero. This is because employing personalized pricing induces the rival firm to engage more in reducing its costs, which is more likely to harm the less-efficient firm.",

A previous dose-escalation study determined that abciximab could be given safely in a regimen of 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by a 12-hour infusion at 0.125 \u03bcg/kg per minute (maximum 10 \u03bcg/min). This study was performed to obtain more information about the safety and potential efficacy of abciximab in patients with stroke.Methods\u2014 An international randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial enrolled 400 patients within 6 hours of onset of ischemic stroke. The primary safety outcome was the rate of symptomatic hemorrhage that occurred during the first 5 days after stroke. The primary efficacy measure was the distribution of outcomes at 3 months after stroke using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) based on an ordinal regression model of outcomes, adjusting for baseline severity of stroke, age, and interval from stroke.Results\u2014 Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 5 days was diagnosed in 7 of 195 (3.6%) patients treated with abciximab and 2 of 199 (1%) patients given placebo (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P=0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 25.9). Asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation was detected by brain imaging in 24 patients administered abciximab and 33 patients receiving placebo (OR, 0.74; P=0.25; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.3). Treatment with abciximab showed a nonsignificant shift in favorable outcomes as measured by mRS scores at 3 months (OR, 1.20; P=0.33; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.70).Conclusions\u2014 Intravenously administered abciximab can be given to patients with a reasonable degree of safety. The trial also suggests that abciximab could improve outcomes at 3 months after stroke. A larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is necessary to test the efficacy of abciximab.",

        "abstract": "Today, it is common for a medical product to be fully effective for only about 60 percent of those who use it. As the medical community is now learning, this in part reflects biological variation among individuals that affects the clinical response. In the past, they have not had the tools or knowledge to understand those differences. \"Personalized medicine\" refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. It does not liberally mean the creation of drugs of medical devices that are unique to a patient but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease or their response to a specific treatment. Personalized medicine may be considered an extension of traditional approaches to understanding and treating disease. Physicians have always used observable evidence to make a diagnosis or prescribe a treatment tailored to each individual. In the modern conception of personalized medicine, the tools provided to the physician are more precise, probing not just the visually obvious, but the very molecular makeup of each patient. It is an approach that is well suited to the medical challenges faced in the 21st century. Although we have prevailed over many of the diseases that have plagued humanity throughout the ages, what remains are diseases of greater complexity: diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. They are not caused by a single gene or a single event but by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and they tend to be chronic, placing a heavy burden on the healthcare system. Personalized medicine provides the tools needed to better manage chronic diseases and treat them more effectively. As evidence of the benefits continues to grow, an infrastructure of laws, policy, education, and clinical practice is building around personalized medicine to support its use. Ultimately, the success of personalized medicine will rise or fall on its ability to demonstrate its value- to the healthcare system, to the.",

However, effective personalized search requires collecting and aggregating user information, which often raise serious concerns of privacy infringement for many users. Indeed, these concerns have become one of the main barriers for deploying personalized search applications, and how to do privacy-preserving personalization is a great challenge. In this paper, we systematically examine the issue of privacy preservation in personalized search. We distinguish and define four levels of privacy protection, and analyze various software architectures for personalized search. We show that client-side personalization has advantages over the existing server-side personalized search services in preserving privacy, and envision possible future strategies to fully protect user privacy.",

However, while allo-HSCT usually induces a beneficial graft-versus leukemia effect, a major source of morbidity and mortality following allo-HSCT is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Currently available diagnostic and staging tools frequently fail to identify those at higher risk for GVHD morbidity, treatment unresponsiveness, and death. Furthermore, there are shortcomings in the risk stratification of patients before GVHD clinical signs develop. In parallel, recent years have been characterized by an explosive evolution of omics technologies, largely due to technological advancements in chemistry, engineering, and bioinformatics. Building on these opportunities, plasma biomarkers have been identified and validated as promising diagnostic and prognostic tools for acute GVHD. This review summarizes current information on the types of GVHD biomarkers, the omics tools used to identify them, the biomarkers currently validated as acute GVHD markers, and future recommendations for incorporating biomarkers into new grading algorithms for risk-stratifying patients and creating more personalized treatment courses. Future directions will include randomized evaluations of these biomarkers in multicenter prospective studies while extending on the need for biomarkers of chronic GVHD.",

Design: Baseline data from a 1:1 randomized, parallel treatment design clinical trial at 23 clinical centers comparing systemic corticosteroid therapy (and immunosuppression when indicated) with fluocinolone acetonide implant placement. Methods: Eligible patients had active or recently active noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. The study design had 90% power (2-sided type I error rate, 0.05) to detect a 7.5-letter (1.5-line) difference between groups in the mean visual acuity change between baseline and 2 years. Secondary outcomes include ocular and systemic complications of therapy and quality of life. Baseline characteristics include demographic and clinical characteristics, quality of life, and reading center gradings of lens and fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography images, and fluorescein angiograms. Results: Over 3 years, 255 patients were enrolled (481 eyes with uveitis). At baseline, 50% of eyes with uveitis had best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 (16% worse than 20/200). Lens opacities (39% of gradeable phakic eyes), macular edema (36%), and epiretinal membrane (48%) were common. Mean health utility was 74.1. Conclusions: The MUST trial will compare fluocinolone acetonide implant versus systemic therapy for management of intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. Patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis enrolled in the trial had a high burden of reduced visual acuity, cataract, macular edema, and epiretinal membrane; overall quality of life was lower than expected based on visual acuity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The Oncotyrol model evaluates the 21-gene assay by simulating a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women over a lifetime horizon using discrete event simulation. Primary model outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We followed the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) best practice recommendations for validation and compared modeling results of the Oncotyrol model with the state-transition model developed by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative. Both models were populated with Canadian THETA model parameters, and outputs were compared.\\n\\nRESULTS: . The differences between the models varied among the different validation end points. The smallest relative differences were in costs, and the greatest were in QALYs. All relative differences were less than 1.2%. The cost-effectiveness plane showed that small differences in the model structure can lead to different sets of nondominated test-treatment strategies with different efficiency frontiers. We faced several challenges: distinguishing between differences in outcomes due to different modeling techniques and initial coding errors, defining meaningful differences, and selecting measures and statistics for comparison (means, distributions, multivariate outcomes).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: . Cross-model validation was crucial to identify and correct coding errors and to explain differences in model outcomes. In our comparison, small differences in either QALYs or costs led to changes in ICERs because of changes in the set of dominated and nondominated strategies.",

It is the most common, severe, progressive skeletal illness that has been increasing, particularly in developed countries. Osteoporosis will no doubt constitute a serious clinical burden in healthcare management in the coming decades. The genetics of osteoporosis should be analyzed from both the disease susceptibility and the pharmacogenetic treatment perspectives. The former has been widely studied and discussed, while the latter still requires much more information and research. This article provides a synthesis of the literature on the genetics of osteoporosis and an update on progress made in pharmacogenetics of osteoporosis in recent years, specifically regarding the new molecular targets for antiresorptive drugs. In-depth translation of osteoporosis pharmacogenetics approaches to clinical practice demands a new vision grounded on the concept of \"theranostics,\" that is, the integration of diagnostics for both disease susceptibility testing, as well as for prediction of health intervention outcomes. In essence, theranostics signals a broadening in the scope of inquiry in diagnostics medicine. The upcoming wave of theranostics medicine also suggests more distributed forms of science and knowledge production, both by experts and end-users of scientific products. Both the diagnosis and personalized treatment of osteoporosis could conceivably benefit from the emerging postgenomics field of theranostics. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

However, little is known about their relative or combined effectiveness.Objective\u00a0 To evaluate the effectiveness of 4 treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder.Design, Setting, and Participants\u00a0 Randomized controlled trial of a volunteer sample of 439 patients between the ages of 12 to 17 years with a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The trial was conducted at 13 US academic and community clinics between spring 2000 and summer 2003.Interventions\u00a0 Twelve weeks of (1) fluoxetine alone (10 to 40 mg/d), (2) CBT alone, (3) CBT with fluoxetine (10 to 40 mg/d), or (4) placebo (equivalent to 10 to 40 mg/d). Placebo and fluoxetine alone were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT with fluoxetine were administered unblinded.Main Outcome Measures\u00a0 Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score and, for responder analysis, a (dichotomized) Clinical Global Impressions improvement score.Results\u00a0 Compared with placebo, the combination of fluoxetine with CBT was statistically significant (P = .001) on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Compared with fluoxetine alone (P = .02) and CBT alone (P = .01), treatment of fluoxetine with CBT was superior. Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment to CBT alone (P = .01). Rates of response for fluoxetine with CBT were 71.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-80%); fluoxetine alone, 60.6% (95% CI, 51%-70%); CBT alone, 43.2% (95% CI, 34%-52%); and placebo, 34.8% (95% CI, 26%-44%). On the Clinical Global Impressions improvement responder analysis, the 2 fluoxetine-containing conditions were statistically superior to CBT and to placebo. Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was present in 29% of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4 treatment groups. Fluoxetine with CBT showed the greatest reduction (P = .02). Seven (1.6%) of 439 patients attempted suicide; there were no completed suicides.Conclusion\u00a0 The combination of fluoxetine with CBT offered the most favorable tradeoff between benefit and risk for adolescents with major depressive disorder.",

Effects on mortality, the magnitude and durability of benefits, and criteria for the selection of patients have not been established. methods A total of 1218 patients with severe emphysema underwent pulmonary rehabilitation and were randomly assigned to undergo lung-volume\u2013reduction surgery or to receive continued medical treatment. results Overall mortality was 0.11 death per person-year in both treatment groups (risk ratio for death in the surgery group, 1.01; P=0.90). After 24 months, exercise capacity had improved by more than 10 W in 15 percent of the patients in the surgery group, as com- pared with 3 percent of patients in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001). With the ex- clusion of a subgroup of 140 patients at high risk for death from surgery according to an interim analysis, overall mortality in the surgery group was 0.09 death per person- year, as compared with 0.10 death per person-year in the medical-therapy group (risk ratio, 0.89; P=0.31); exercise capacity after 24 months had improved by more than 10 W in 16 percent of patients in the surgery group, as compared with 3 percent of patients in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001). Among patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity, mortality was lower in the surgery group than in the medical-therapy group (risk ratio for death, 0.47; P=0.005).

It does yield a sur- vival advantage for patients with both predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low base-line exercise capacity.

        "abstract": "There are a number of effective treatments for breast cancer in the neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic setting. These comprise combinations of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal treatments and targeted molecular therapies. However the benefit that individual patients derive from these treatments and the toxicity that they experience varies considerably. Differences in cancer patient's responses to therapy can be associated with factors such as disease burden, drug interactions, age, gender and nutritional status amongst others. It is now also known that genetic variations in drug target genes, disease pathway genes and drug metabolizing enzymes can have important role and influence on the efficacy and toxicity of a particular therapy. These genetic variations may be due to variations in individual's germ line DNA or to somatic changes in the malignant cells. Understanding the genetic profile of the patient and the tumour will help to further refine therapies. Pharmacogenomics can be used to predict response to treatments that are known to have activity against breast cancer including anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, taxanes, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and herceptin. The reliability and reproducibility of techniques needs to be validated in large randomized studies before they can be incorporated into routine clinical practice. Thus pharmacogenomics will help develop a profile to tailor therapies with minimal toxicity and maximum efficacy based on molecular signatures. This review discusses clinically relevant germ line mutations that can be used to predict response and toxicity to the above treatments as well as microarray based expression profile studies that may yield important information about prognosis, indication for treatment and response to treatment. The completion of the human genome project and advances in high through-put DNA sequencing and proteomic technology means that there is a real opportunity for pharmacogenomic assessment to become a clinically important part of the decision making process in determining the optimum adjuvant treatment regimen for patients with early stage breast cancer and aiding the management of advanced breast cancer, allowing clinicians to create an individual management plan for each breast cancer patient based on pharmacogenomic data. \u00a9 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

CYP3A4 intron 6 C>T polymorphism (CYP3A4*22 allele, rs35599367) has been recently identified and was associated with reduced CYP3A4 expression. We analyzed the association of CYP3A4*22 allele with response to atorvastatin and simvastatin. Methods: A total of 416 statin-treated (207 atorvastatin- and 209 simvastatin-treated) adults with primary hypercholesterolemia were included in the study. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured at baseline and on 6 months of treatment. CYP3A4*22 allele was analyzed with TaqMan assay. Results: In the entire cohort population, 41 individuals carried CYP3A4*22 allele (18 in atorvastatin and 23 in simvastatin treatment). CYP3A4*22 allele was not associated with lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin or simvastatin. No sex-gene or statin dose-gene interaction was observed in either statin-treated patient cohort. Conclusions: The effect of CYP3A4*22 allele on lipid-lowering response to CYP3A metabolized statins, if present, can potentially be masked by relevant confounding or uncontrolled factors; therefore, further population-driven studies are required.",

        "abstract": "HER2 is over-expressed in approximately 25% to 30% of human metastatic breast cancers, primarily due to gene amplification. There are currently two HER2-targeted therapies approved for clinical use, the monoclonal HER2 antibody trastuzumab and the EGFR/HER2 dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. Although both agents show clinical benefit in a subset of patients with metastatic breast cancer, many patients with HER2-over-expressing metastatic breast tumors do not respond to these agents. Furthermore, those who do show an initial response generally demonstrate disease progression, on average in less than one year. It has become clear that HER2 expression status alone does not adequately predict response to HER2-targeted therapy. Identification and clinical validation of molecular predictors of response to trastuzumab and lapatinib is critical for further personalizing treatment and improving clinical benefit for patients whose tumors over-express HER2. In this review, we discuss published data describing potential predictors of response or resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib. While a discussion of the preclinical work is provided, the emphasis is placed on potential predictors that have been studied in clinical specimens such as tumor tissue or serum obtained from patients treated with HER2-targeted therapy. The present analysis and synthesis of the available literature therefore contribute towards an emerging knowledgebase to personalize breast cancer treatment taking into factors including but beyond HER2 expression.",

It is well recognized that genetic variation can contribute to differences in drug disposition and, consequently, clinical efficacy at the population level. Pharmacogenetics, exploring genetic polymorphisms that influence response to drug therapy, may one day allow the clinician to customize treatment strategies for patients in order to improve the success rate of drug therapies. To date, 41 studies have investigated the relationships between common genetic variants and response to statin therapy in terms of lipid effects and clinical outcomes; 16 candidate genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and 3 in pharmacokinetics. APOE is the most extensively studied locus, and absolute difference in LDL cholesterol reduction across genotypes remained 3-6%. Moreover, none of the associations was striking enough to justify genetic analysis in clinical practice. Reported data have suggested that larger studies (>1000 participants) or combination analyses with >2 different polymorphisms would enable us to find clinically or biologically meaningful difference, which could be assumed as >10% absolute difference, and that genes influencing cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, such as ABCG5/G8, CYP7A1, HMGCR, would be good candidates for future studies.",

Pharmacometrics is the science of quantifying disease, drug and trial characteristics with the goal to influence key drug development, regulatory and therapeutic decisions. Pharmacometric analysis as a tool has revolutionized the way dose/dosing regimens or clinical trials are being designed prospectively to answer key drug development questions. Exposure-response relationships established in adult patients have made it possible to make dosing recommendations in special populations (pediatrics and organ function impaired patients), leading to approval of doses/dosing regimen that were not studied in registration trials. Until now, pharmacogenomics is predominantly used retrospectively to understand the between subject variability of drug's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. In this article we discuss how the advent of advanced pharmacometric tools can leverage prior pharmacogenomic information to prospectively design late stage clinical trials.

        "abstract": "With growing information on antiretroviral drug pharmacogenetics, several studies have been conducted in African countries. One unique strand of knowledge that is currently emerging is the use of dried plasma spot devices in rural communities in Africa with a view to individualizying drugs employed against HIV infection. The results are encouraging as a relatively inexpensive test could inform on the probability of adverse reactions or treatment failure, thus helping to select the best regimen for a given patient in different African populations. This could have an important impact in African countries where anti-viral therapy failures (whether related to low adherence/intolerance or to resistance/insufficient drugs exposure) have huge associated costs, both in terms of disease progression and money expenditure. Data on the available information on pharmacogenetics in African patients as well as patients of African descendant are reviewed. Nevertheless no randomized controlled study evaluating the impact of pharmacogenetics in Africa has so far been conducted, particularly with a view to employing novel diagnostic platforms such as dried plasma/blood spot devices in rural communities. Following the discussed data a few candidate genes are suggested as potential candidates for prospective studies taking into account two pitfalls in the path towards individualized antiretroviral regimens in Africa: the reliance on non-African based laboratories that signal the need for local capacity building as well as international collaborations, and finally the need to better understand genetic diversity of different ethnic groups in the African continent.

        "abstract": "Personalized medicine (PM) in neurosurgery is possible today thanks to newly accessible imaging technologies, and to genomic, proteomic and epigenetic biomarkers capable of providing clinically useful information about individual patients. PM is becoming increasingly indispensable in neurosurgery because this specialty offers a wide range of therapeutic options such as surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Moreover, the effectiveness of these procedures varies from one patient to another, depending inter alia on the patients' individual genomic traits. A prime example is glioblastoma multiforme, which exhibits at least five genomic biomarkers related to distinct therapeutic and prognostic outcomes. At least one of these biomarkers, the ??-6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter of methylation status, has already been used in clinical trials. New functional imaging techniques allow the surgeon to circumvent crucial brain areas whose location may vary among patients, thus allowing the safe and complete excision of an adjacent tumor. Functional imaging, together with an increasing number of genomic and other 'omic' biomarkers, has also given rise to an improved classification based on molecular signatures of tumors like glioblastoma multiforme that will facilitate the correspondence between type of glioma and choice of biologically tailored-to-patient therapy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

A qualitative, public deliberation study was undertaken using a citizens' reference panel on health technologies, established to provide input to the health technology assessment process in Ontario, Canada. The citizens' panel consisted of five women and nine men, aged 18-71 years, with one member selected from each health authority region. There were shared expectations among the citizens' panel members for the potential of personalized medicine technologies to improve care, provided they are deemed clinically valid and effective. These expectations were tempered by concerns about value for money and the possibility that access to treatment may be limited by personalized medicine tests used to stratify patients. Although they questioned the presumed technological imperative presented by personalized medicine technologies, they called for increased efforts to prepare the health-care system to effectively integrate these technologies. This study represents an early but important effort to explore public values toward personalized medicine. This study also provides evidence of the public's ability to form coherent judgments about a new policy issue. Concerned that personalized tests might be used to ration care, they suggested that treatment should be made available if patients wanted it, irrespective of tests that indicate little benefit. This issue raises clinical and policy challenges that may undermine the value of personalized medicine. Further efforts to deliberate with the public are warranted to inform effective, efficient and equitable translation of personalized medicine.",

The long-acting \ue0012 adrenoreceptor (\ue0012AR) agonists and long-acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonists have been widely used as bronchodilatory therapies in these clinical indications. These treatments are, however, far from ideal and display limited efficacy, particularly in COPD. Specific guidelines on how best to customize therapeutic regimens for individual patients are yet to be formulated. The polymorphisms within the coding block of the \ue0012AR gene are strongly associated with receptor function and affect the long-term response to \ue0012AR agonists in patients with asthma. Two pertinent drug target receptor subtype families, mAChRs and \ue0012ARs, belong to the common seven-transmembrane spanning family of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Cell biology studies indicate that biosignals from one GPCR can modify another receptor function through intracellular signaling and molecular cross-talk. Thus, it is conceivable that gene-gene (epistatic) interactions between these two receptors may occur, modifying the bronchodilatory response to drugs acting at these molecular targets. In accordance with this, our recent empirical observations suggest that the \ue0012AR genotypes may influence differential bronchodilatory response to anticholinergic agents in patients with COPD and asthma. This review aims to highlight (1) the pharmacogenetic associations of \ue0012AR gene variants with drug response in patients with asthma and COPD and (2) the importance of considering gene-gene interactions for personalization of drug therapy and the value of \u2018pathway pharmacogenetics\u2019 more generally.",

The objective of this investigation was to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin (because of their pleiotropic properties) as an adjunct to dental scaling and root planing (SRP) by local delivery, i.e. placing them subgingivally, in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Local delivery systems for atorvastatin and simvastatin were prepared in sodium alginate suspension to be administered with calcium chloride solution. Patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were grouped as group 1, receiving SRP only (control), group 2, receiving SRP with subgingival delivery of 1.2% simvastatin, and group 3, receiving SRP with subgingival delivery of 1.2% atorvastatin. Clinical parameters and interleukin (IL) 1alpha levels in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were assessed. RESULTS: All three groups showed significant reductions in clinical parameters and IL-1alpha levels in the GCF (p<0.05). However, the test groups did not show any statistically significant difference when compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Subgingivally delivered atorvastatin and simvastatin as an adjunct to SRP is efficacious but did not demonstrate any added benefit as compared with SRP alone.",

To date, the drug of choice for the treatment of ALL is methotrexate, a drug associated with a high risk of adverse reactions (ADRs). The xanthine oxidase (XO) polymorphisms, 1936A>G and 2107A>G, as well as the polymorphic variants derived from ATP-binding cassette transporter gene subfamilies, ABCB1 and ABCC5, of drug resistant codifying genes, are implicated as precursors of drug-related neurologic, hepatic, and renal toxicities. Our aim was to determine whether the mentioned polymorphisms are risk or protective factors for the development of adverse reactions by methotrexate in our pediatric population with ALL. Methods: A total of 35 Mexican children from Centro Estatal de Cancerologia-Durango, Mexico, with ALL and the previously noted polymorphisms as determined qPCR were studied. At the same time, a 12-month drug monitoring program was conducted in accordance with WHO-PAHO guidelines for pharmacovigilance. Results: The ABCB11936A>G and 2107A>G and ABCC5 3414+434A>C polymorphisms were not associated with methotrexate ADRs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 1236C>T (OR 0.19, 95% CI: 0.03-0.9, p<0.05) and ABCC5 3933+313T>C (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.027-0.58, p<0.05) were associated with methotrexate ADRs. Conclusions: SNPs 1236C>T of ABCB1 and ABCC5 3933+313T>C are not associated with the development of typical ADRs by methotrexate, rather, they showed a protective factor for myelosuppression in the studied sick population.",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to resistance will allow identification of novel therapeutic targets and predictors of therapeutic response. To this end, up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins has been associated with resistance to the HER2-targeted drug lapatinib, but has not yet been linked to Herceptin resistance. The aim of the current study was to determine if the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein is a potential therapeutic target in cells with acquired Herceptin resistance. The BT474 HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line and BT474-derived acquired Herceptin-resistant clones were used as models in this study. Bcl-2 and Bax expression were assessed by Western blotting. Proliferation assays were performed on cells treated with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 in the absence or presence of Herceptin. Finally, the effect of PI3K inhibition or IKK inhibition on Bcl-2 expression and Herceptin sensitivity was examined by Western blotting and established proliferation assays. We show that cells with acquired resistance to Herceptin have an increased Bcl-2:Bax ratio. Resistant cells have increased sensitivity to ABT-737. Further, pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-2 improved sensitivity to Herceptin in acquired resistant cells. Finally, PI3K and IKK inhibition down-regulated Bcl-2 expression and increased sensitivity to Herceptin in resistant cells. Taken together, these new observations support further study of Bcl-2-targeted therapies in Herceptin-resistant breast cancers, and importantly, future investigation of Bcl-2 expression as a potential predictor of Herceptin response in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.",

We define precision medicine as treatments targeted to the needs of individual patients on the basis of genetic, biomarker, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics that distinguish a given patient from other patients with similar clinical presentations. Inherent in this definition is the goal of improving clinical outcomes for individual patients and minimizing unnecessary side effects for those less likely to have a response to a particular treatment.

Individualized care plans, also described as personalized medicine, still must be developed by understanding and implementing basic science research into clinical treatment.

As such, proteomics can help translate basic science discoveries into the clinical practice of personalized medicine.

In-depth characterization of study participants and patients in general practice using standardized methods is a pivotal component of study design in personalized medicine. Standardization and quality assurance of clinical data are similarly important, but in daily practice imprecise definitions of clinical variables can reduce power and introduce bias, which limits the validity of the data obtained as well as their potential clinical applicability. Changes in statistical methods with personalized medicine include a shift from dichotomous outcomes towards continuously measured variables, predictive modelling, and individualized medical decisions, subgroup analyses, and data-mining strategies. A variety of approaches to personalized medicine exist in cardiovascular research and clinical practice that might have the potential to individualize diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. For some of the emerging methods, such as data mining, the most-efficient way to use these tools is not yet fully understood. In addition, the predictive models-although promising-are far from mature, and are likely to be greatly improved by using available large-scale data sets.",

However, previous experience demonstrates that drug development for central nervous system (CNS) disorders has a high failure rate. Personalized medicine, or the approach to identifying the right treatment for the right patient, has recently become the standard for drug development in the oncology field. In addition to utilizing Companion Diagnostics (CDx) that identify specific genetic biomarkers to prescribe certain targeted therapies, patient profiling is regularly used to enrich for a responsive patient population during clinical trials, resulting in fewer patients required for statistical significance and a higher rate of success for demonstrating efficacy and hence receiving approval for the drug. This personalized medicine approach may be one mechanism that could reduce the high clinical trial failure rate in the development of CNS drugs. This review will discuss current circadian trials, the history of personalized medicine in oncology, lessons learned from a recently approved circadian therapeutic, and how personalized medicine can be tailored for use in future clinical trials for circadian disorders to ultimately lead to the approval of more therapeutics for patients suffering from circadian abnormalities.",

However, the identification of mutation-positive patients is limited by a lack of funding for testing. The length of time required to receive test results and insufficient tissue from biopsies are additional limitations.

Evolving topics in personalized oncology such as genomic analysis, targeted drugs, cancer therapeutics and molecular diagnostics will be discussed in this review. Biomarkers and molecular individualized medicine are replacing the traditional \"one size fits all\" medicine. In the next decade the treatment of cancer will move from a reactive to a proactive discipline. The essence of personalized oncology lies in the use of biomarkers. These biomarkers can be from tissue, serum, urine or imaging and must be validated. Personalized oncology based on biomarkers is already having a remarkable impact. Three different types of biomarkers are of particular importance: predictive, prognostic and early response biomarkers. Tools for implementing preemptive medicine based on genetic and molecular diagnostic and interventions will improve cancer prevention. Imaging technologies such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emitted Tomography (PET) are already influencing the early detection and management of the cancer patient. Future advances in imaging are expected to be in the field of molecular imaging, integrated diagnostics, biology driven interventional radiology and theranostics. Molecular diagnostics identify individual cancer patients who are more likely to respond positively to targeted chemotherapies. Molecular diagnostics include testing for genes, gene expression, proteins and metabolites. The use of companion molecular diagnostics is expected to grow significantly in the future and will be integrated into new cancer therapies a single (bundled) package which will provide greater efficiency, value and cost savings. This approach represents a unique opportunity for integration, increased value in personalized oncology.",

        "abstract": "South Africa, like many other developing countries, stands to benefit from novel diagnostics and drugs developed by pharmacogenomics guidance due to high prevalence of disease burden in the region. This includes both communicable (e.g., HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis) and non-communicable (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular) diseases. For example, although only 0.7% of the world's population lives in South Africa, the country carries 17% of the global HIV/AIDS burden and 5% of the global tuberculosis burden. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has coined the term Rainbow Nation, referring to a land of wealth in its many diverse peoples and cultures. It is now timely and necessary to reflect on how best to approach new genomics biotechnologies in a manner that carefully considers the public health needs and extant disease burden in the region. The aim of this paper is to document and review the advances in pharmacogenomics in South Africa and importantly, to evaluate the direction that future research should take. Previous research has shown that the populations in South Africa exhibit unique allele frequencies and novel genetic variation in pharmacogenetically relevant genes, often differing from other African and global populations. The high level of genetic diversity, low linkage disequilibrium and the presence of rare variants in these populations question the feasibility of the use of current commercially available genotyping platforms, and may partially account for genotype-phenotype discordance observed in past studies. However, the employment of high throughput technologies for genomic research, within the context of large clinical trials, combined with interdisciplinary studies and appropriate regulatory guidelines, should aid in acceleration of pharmacogenomic discoveries in high priority therapeutic areas in South Africa. Finally, we suggest that projects such as the H3Africa Initiative, the SAHGP and PGENI should play an integral role in the coordination of genomic research in South Africa, but also other African countries, by providing infrastructure and capital to local researchers, as well as providing aid in addressing the computational and statistical bottlenecks encountered at present.",

However, due to co-morbidities, patients are often exposed to many drugs concurrently. Most of these drugs are metabolised by similar enzymes which are polymorphic, thus, drug-drug interactions are a constant problem. Quantitative and qualitative differences in drug metabolizing enzyme variants in different populations result in differential drug response. This study investigated the baseline frequencies of genetic variants in key drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in two previously understudied Bantu-speaking populations from Cameroon (N=72) and South Africa (N=163) using PCR-RFLP. Genotype frequencies for CYP1A2 C-163A and CYP3A4 A-392G single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly different between these two populations (P=0.0004 and 0.0079, respectively). Significant differences were also observed when the two Bantu-speaking populations were each compared to other African populations as well as Caucasian and Asian populations. Importantly, correspondence analysis showed that the two Bantu-speaking African populations were separated from each other and from other African populations based on CYP1A2 C-163A and CYP2A6 G1093A SNPs. The data show that drugs that are substrates for these polymorphic enzymes are likely to have different response profiles among the Bantu-speaking populations and populations of either Caucasian or Asian origin, further emphasizing the need to genetically characterise as many African populations in order to realize personalised medicine. These data further emphasize that linguistically related Bantu-speaking populations are not necessarily genetically homogenous. Finally, we note that our observations also inform future pharmacogeneticguided rational therapeutic drug monitoring to prevent or minimize the risk for adverse drug-drug interactions mediated by these genetically polymorphic pathways.

This highly polymorphic enzyme exhibits vastly different phenotypes: poor metabolizers show no enzyme activity, whilst ultrarapid metabolizers exhibit a significantly higher activity. Between these two extremes, there are the extensive and intermediate metabolizers, two heterogeneous groups with overlapping boundaries concerning CYP2D6 activity. These different phenotype groups can be correlated partly to the genotype of an individual. More than 70 different CYP2D6 alleles have been described to date, which encode for null alleles, have a decreased activity or carry gene duplications. However, there is a need for guidelines to translate different CYP2D6 allele combinations into phenotypes. We hereby summarize the current state of the knowledge concerning the relationship between CYP2D6 genotype and pheno- type. Clinical relevance of CYP2D6 variation is highlighted with respect to both drugs and putative endogenous ligands.

This research is crucial as pharmacogenomics applications are advancing towards public health. In order to learn about the perceptions stakeholders have towards the relevance of genomics for public health research and the related issues, we conducted qualitative social science research and interviews with genomics researchers, epidemiologists and virologists, ethics and law specialists, and decision makers. A thematic data analysis was undertaken to extract their views. Stakeholders acknowledged that genomics holds substantial potential to drive forward scientific advances. There was however no consensus on the types of interventions needed to integrate genetic information into public health research strategies. Despite their positive expectations, the respondents asserted that the integration of these two fields have to be in the public's best interest. In particular, the importance of scientific evidence on genomic determinants of health was emphasized. Proof of transparency and accountability also needed to be taken into account. These elements were deemed to be crucial to counter the potential rejection of research at the confluence of genomics and public health, to protect individuals and engage scientists in \"sound science\". Even though collective values have been an integral part of public health genomics, this new field of inquiry warrants further exploration about how, and to what ends interdisciplinary research should be carried out, the importance of efficient communication mechanisms for knowledge translation and a widening of the scope of research ethics in the near future.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of human genomic variation in relation to individual and population variability in medication response and side effects. Neuropsychiatry is one of the clinical domains in which pharmacogenomic approaches have been extensively studied. In the late 1990s, the Glycine9 (Gly9) allele of the Serine-9-Glycine (Ser9Gly) polymorphism in dopamine D3 receptor gene (DRD3) was found to be associated with both a liability to, and worsened severity of, TD in schizophrenic patients treated with typical antipsychotics. This initial discovery has been subsequently replicated and testing for the Ser9Gly polymorphism has now become commercially available. The question that currently presents itself is whether its use should be encouraged for patients who may be prescribed a typical or atypical antipsychotic medication. However, the translation of this new technology to clinical practice presents multiple social, ethical and policy challenges. Though pharmacogenomic testing holds much promise in this scenario, many important questions remain to be answered before its widespread use can be medically and ethically justified. This article highlights the key advances in our understanding of the role of human genetic variation in the D3 receptor in relation to TD. Then, issues of uncertainty, consent, confidentiality, and access are considered with respect to the use of DRD3 polymorphism testing in risk stratification for susceptibility to tardive dyskinesia. We propose three recommendations that may help bring this technology into the clinic: 1) prospective pharmacogenomic studies of DRD3 polymorphism and TD risk should be conducted; 2) the design of such studies should be influenced by scientists, ethicists and policy makers to protect potentially vulnerable patients; and 3) appropriate knowledge transfer to front-line health care workers must take place.",

As cancer genetics continues to impact not only prevention strategies but also treatment decisions, current cancer genetic counseling models will need to be tailored to accommodate emerging clinical indications. These clinical indications include: surgical prophylactic bilateral mastectomy candidates, PARP-inhibitor candidates, patients with abnormal tumor screening results for Lynch syndrome, and post-test counseling patients (after genetic testing is ordered by another healthcare provider).

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Studies have demonstrated that statins administered to individuals with risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) reduce CHD events. However, many of these studies were too small to assess all-cause mortality or outcomes in important subgroups. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pravastatin compared with usual care reduces all-cause mortality in older, moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive participants with at least 1 additional CHD risk factor. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter (513 primarily community-based North American clinical centers), randomized, nonblinded trial conducted from 1994 through March 2002 in a subset of participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory persons (n = 10 355), aged 55 years or older, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL if known CHD) and triglycerides lower than 350 mg/dL, were randomized to pravastatin (n = 5170) or to usual care (n = 5185). Baseline mean total cholesterol was 224 mg/dL; LDL-C, 146 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 48 mg/dL; and triglycerides, 152 mg/dL. Mean age was 66 years, 49% were women, 38% black and 23% Hispanic, 14% had a history of CHD, and 35% had type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION: Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, vs usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with follow-up for up to 8 years. Secondary outcomes included nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD (CHD events) combined, cause-specific mortality, and cancer. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 4.8 years. During the trial, 32% of usual care participants with and 29% without CHD started taking lipid-lowering drugs. At year 4, total cholesterol levels were reduced by 17% with pravastatin vs 8% with usual care; among the random sample who had LDL-C levels assessed, levels were reduced by 28% with pravastatin vs 11% with usual care. All-cause mortality was similar for the 2 groups (relative risk [RR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.11; P =.88), with 6-year mortality rates of 14.9% for pravastatin vs 15.3% with usual care. CHD event rates were not significantly different between the groups (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79-1.04; P =.16), with 6-year CHD event rates of 9.3% for pravastatin and 10.4% for usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin did not reduce either all-cause mortality or CHD significantly when compared with usual care in older participants with well-controlled hypertension and moderately elevated LDL-C. The results may be due to the modest differential in total cholesterol (9.6%) and LDL-C (16.7%) between pravastatin and usual care compared with prior statin trials supporting cardiovascular disease prevention.",

Due to the limitations of standard diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, the disease treatment is moving towards tailored treatment for individual patients, considering the inter-individual variability in therapeutic response. Theranostics, which involves the combination of therapy and diagnostic imaging into a single system, may fulfill the promise of personalized medicine. By integrating molecular imaging functionalities into therapy, theranostic approach could be advantageous in therapy selection, treatment planning, objective response monitoring and follow-up therapy planning based on the specific molecular characteristics of a disease. Although the field of therapy and imaging of its response have been independently developed thus far, developing imaging strategies can be fully exploited to revolutionize the theranostic systems in combination with the therapy modality. In this review, we describe the recent advances in molecular imaging technologies that have been specifically developed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy for theranostic purposes. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

The aim of this study is to quantitatively summarize whether GGCX gene polymorphisms have potential roles in warfarin dose requirement. Methods: Publications were searched in PubMed, Medline and ISI Web of Knowledge and chosen by exact inclusion and exclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted by using Revman 5.0 software to determine the association between common polymorphisms of the three genes and warfarin dose requirement. Results: Data were extracted from 13 publications with 4167 patients enrolled. Two common polymorphisms (rs699664, rs12714145) of GGCX were included for further meta-analyses. Comparing to rs699664AA geontype carriers, rs699664GG genotype carriers requered higer 3% [95% CI: 2% -4%, P-valus < 0.0001] warfarin dose. The warfarin dosage requirement showed no significant difference between rs699664GG and rs699664GA genotype carriers, P=0.51. Compared to rs12714145AA carriers, the GG and GA genotype carriers needed 5% (95% CI, 1% -9%; P = 0.01) and 4% (95% CI, 1% -8%; P = 0.02) lower warfarin dosage, respectively. The warfarin dosage requirement showed no significant difference between GG and GA genotype carriers, P=0.12. Conclusion: Our study showed that GGCX polymorphisms were significantly associated with warfarin dose requirement.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) did not show overall benefit as an adjunct smoking cessation treatment for adult smokers with ADHD in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. A secondary analysis revealed a significant interaction between ADHD symptom severity and treatment-response to OROS-MPH, but did not account for other baseline covariates or estimate the magnitude of improvement in outcome if treatment were optimized. This present study addressed the gaps in how this relationship should inform clinical practice. METHODS: Using data from the Adult Smokers with ADHD Trial (N = 255, six sites in five US States), we build predictive models to calculate the probability of achieving prolonged abstinence, verified by self-report, and expired carbon monoxide measurement. We evaluate the potential improvement in achieving prolonged abstinence with and without stratification on baseline ADHD severity. RESULTS: Predictive modeling demonstrates that the interaction between baseline ADHD severity and treatment group is not affected by adjusting for other baseline covariates. A clinical trial simulation shows that giving OROS-MPH to patients with baseline Adult ADHD Symptom Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) >35 and placebo to those with ADHD-RS </=35 would significantly improve the prolonged abstinence rate (52 +/- 8% vs. 42 +/- 5%, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In smokers with ADHD, utilization of a simple decision rule that stratifies patients based on baseline ADHD severity can enhance overall achievement of prolonged smoking abstinence. Similar analysis methods should be considered for future clinical trials for other substance use disorders.",

As treatment response to the main asthma therapies is partly genetically determined, pharmacogenetics may open the way for personalized medicine in children with asthma. However, the number of genes identified for the various asthma drug response phenotypes remains small and randomized controlled trials are lacking. Biomarkers in exhaled breath or breath condensate remain promising but did not find their way from bench to bedside yet, except for the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide.

        "abstract": "Some ribosomal antibiotics used in clinical practice to fight pathogenic bacteria can provoke serious adverse drug reactions in patients. Sensitivity to the antibiotics is a multifactorial trait but the genetic variation of sensitive individuals to off-target effects of the drugs might be one of the factors contributing to this condition. Thus, the protein synthesis apparatus of mitochondria is similar to that of bacteria because of its endosymbiotic origin and, therefore, mitochondrial ribosomes are frequently unintended off-targets of these antibiotics. Because of the limitations of epidemiologic studies of pharmacogenomics, we constructed 25 transmitochondrial cell lines using platelets from individuals belonging to high-frequency European mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and grew them in the absence or presence of commonly used ribosomal antibiotics. Next, we analyzed the mitochondrial synthesis of proteins and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption to ascertain whether some side effects of ribosomal drugs are due to their interaction with particular mtDNA haplogroup-defining polymorphisms. The amount of mitochondrial translation products, the p.MT-CO1/succinate dehydrogenase subunit A ratio and the ratio of respiratory complex IV quantity to citrate synthase (CS)-specific activity were significantly lower, after the treatment with linezolid, in cybrids harboring the highly frequent m.3010A allele. These results suggest that mitochondrial antibiograms should be implemented for at least the most frequent mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) polymorphisms and combinations of polymorphisms and the most frequently used ribosomal antibiotics. In this way, we would obtain individualized barcodes for antibiotic therapy, avoid the side effects of the antibiotics and enable appropriate personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Personalized healthcare tries to predict the effectiveness and safety in individual therapeutic approaches by defining individual patient characteristics (biomarkers), while stratification uses diagnostic patterns for groups of patients for prediction of therapeutic response with less adverse reactions caused by the drugs applied. Both methods are implemented in oncology and infectiology and in the therapy of rheumatological diseases there is a need for both. Cytokine-directed therapies are important for the treatment of rheumatological diseases, especially when therapy with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has failed. Despite the high potency of these drugs for inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6, sufficient responses are only seen in some of the patients. Therefore, stratification and personalized medicine are ways to optimize efficacy and tolerability of biologic therapies. Some initial evidence is available for potential future strategies using molecular and genetic markers for stratified cytokine inhibition.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is a complex disease characterized by many morphological, clinical and molecular features. For many years, this disease has been classified according to histopathologic criteria, known as the TNM staging system. Clinical criteria that include immunohistochemical markers, such as the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), provide a classification of breast cancer and dictates the optimal therapeutic approach for treatment. With genomic techniques, such as real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), microarrays, next-generation sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing, breast cancer diagnostics is going through a significant evolution. Genomic and transcriptomic technologies make the analysis of gene expression signatures and mutation status possible so that tumors may now be classified more accurately with respect to diagnosis and prognosis. The -omic era has also made possible the identification of new biomarkers involved in breast cancer development, survival and invasion that can be gradually incorporated either into clinical testing or clinical trials. Together, clinical and molecular criteria can contribute to a more personalized management of the breast cancer patient. This article will present the progress made in the diagnosis and management of breast cancer using molecular information provided by genomic and transcriptomic technologies.",

        "abstract": "Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the traditional treatment of choice for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the efficacy of these regimens has reached a plateau. Increasing evidence demonstrates that patients with sensitizing mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) experience improved progression-free survival and response rates with first-line gefitinib or erlotinib therapy relative to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy, while patients with EGFR-mutation negative tumors gain greater benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. These results highlight the importance of molecular testing prior to the initiation of first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. Routine molecular testing of tumor samples represents an important paradigm shift in NSCLC therapy and would allow for individualized therapy in specific subsets of patients. As these and other advances in personalized treatment are integrated into everyday clinical practice, pulmonologists will play a vital role in ensuring that tumor samples of adequate quality and quantity are collected in order to perform appropriate molecular analyses to guide treatment decisions. This article provides an overview of clinical trial data supporting molecular analysis of NSCLC, describes specimen acquisition and testing methods currently in use, and discusses future directions of personalized therapy for patients with NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Intratumor heterogeneity could present significant challenges for the development of personalized treatment approaches for patients with renal cell cancer. As part of a recent multi-institutional collaborative project, Gerlinger et al. performed whole-exome multiregion sequencing analysis on mulitple biopsy samples taken from two patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Around two-thirds of the mutations detected in both patients were heterogenous (not uniformly expressed at all tumor sites) and a significant proportion were 'private mutations' (unique to a specific region), indicating continuous regional clonal evolution. Moreover, in one patient, both 'favorable prognosis' and 'unfavorable prognosis' expression signatures were identified in different regions of the same tumor. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to map out the hierarchical order of specific mutations in the evolution of each patient's tumor. In previous studies, the use of next-generation sequencing has generally been limited to single index lesions, with targeting sequencing approaches applied to other tumor sites. As such, these studies have been underpowered to identify branching tumor evolution. Of the genes known to drive progression of renal cell carcinoma (VHL, KDM5C, SETD2 and MTOR), only VHL was mutated at all analyzed tumor sites\u2014indicating a ubiquitous role in the early stages of tumorigenesis and a position in the main trunk of the phylogenetic tree. SETD2 harbored three distinct mutations with broadly different regional distributions, whereas mutations in KDM5C, MTOR, PTEN and P53 were more localized\u2014placing them further along the branches of the phylogenetic tree. The investigators also used immunohistochemical analysis, mutation functional analysis and mRNA expression profiling to characterize the consequences of intratumor heterogeneity on tissue function. SETD2 protein function (H3K36 trimethylation) was diminished in cancer cells but positive in most surrounding stromal cells, suggesting (together with genomic analysis) that loss of SETD2 function occurs via three spatially distinct mutations following the ubiquitous loss of one SETD2 allele on chromosome 3p. Widespread ploidy alterations and allelic imbalances were also identified in both patients\u2014plus a further two consecutive patients from the E\u2013PREDICT trial. Only four biopsy samples (from a total of 30) shared identical allelic imbalance profiles\u2014all from the same patient, but from different tumor regions. These imbalances, which can affect gene expression, could be the result of chromosome loss or genomic imprinting. \" The main focus of this work was to question how reliably a single biopsy portrays the genomic landscape of a tumor from a deep sequencing perspective \" says Charles Swanton, who led the study. The answer, it seems, is 'not very'. Given that single tumor biopsies are currently used to inform decisions regarding individualized therapy, this finding is unsettling. Although multiregion sampling might improve the predictive accuracy of biopies, this approach is, says Swanton, \" clinically impractical and risky. \" \" I doubt we will see [phylogenetic tumor analysis] implemented in clinical practice in the immediate future, \" Swanton continues. \" We are more likely to focus our efforts on targeting the processes that drive intratumor heterogeneity. \" The identification of common mutations\u2014located in the trunk of the phylogenetic tree\u2014could steer future research in this field. \" This work strengthens the need to target pathways regulated by ubiquitous events like VHL mutations, \" stresses Swanton. \" However, about 40 mutations are present in all tumor locations. The question is, how many are drivers that need to be targeted? I suspect there will be multiple independent drivers of disease biology, most of which will not be immediately therapeutically targetable, and drug resistance may be determined by the heterogeneous mutations that are difficult to detect and target. \" Melanie Clyne Original article Gerlinger, M. et al.

This treatment modality prescribes therapies specific to individual patients based on pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic information. The mapping of the human genome has been an important milestone in understanding the interindividual differences in response to therapy. These differences are attributed to genotypic differences, with consequent phenotypic expression. It is important to note that targeted therapies should ideally be accompanied by a diagnostic marker. However, most efforts are being directed toward developing both these separately; the former by pharmaceutical companies and the later by diagnostic companies. Further, this companion strategy will be successful only when the biomarkers assayed are differentiated on a value-based approach rather than a cost-based approach, especially in countries that reimburse disease management costs. The advantages of using personalized therapies are manifold: targeted patient population; avoidance of drug-related toxicities and optimization of costs in nonresponder patients; reduction in drug development costs, and fewer patients to be tested in clinical trials. The success of personalized therapy in future will depend on a better understanding of pharmacogenomics and the extension of these scientific advances to all countries.",

        "abstract": "In light of a detailed characterization of genetic aberrations in cancer, nucleic acid targeting represents an attractive therapeutic approach with significant translational potential. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with stagnant 5-year survival rates. Advances in conventional treatment have done little to improve survival and combined chemoradiation is associated with significant adverse effects. Recent reports have characterized the genetic alterations in HNSCC and demonstrated that mutations confer resistance to conventional and molecular targeted therapies. The ability to use specific nucleic acid sequences to inhibit cancer-associated genes including non-druggable targets facilitates personalized medicine approaches with less adverse effects. Additionally, advances in drug delivery mechanisms have increased the transfection efficiency aiding in greater therapeutic responses. Given these advances, the stage has been set to translate the information garnered from genomic studies into personalized treatment strategies. Genes involved in the tumor protein 53 and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways have been extensively investigated and many promising preclinical studies have shown tumor inhibition through genetic modulation. We, and others, have demonstrated that targeting oncogene expression with gene therapy approaches is feasible in patients. Other methods such as RNA interference have proven to be effective and are potential candidates for clinical studies. This review summarizes the major advances in sequence-specific gene modulation in the preclinical setting and in clinical trials in head and neck cancer patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.424.",

Therefore, personalized treatment is expected to become a daily routine in prospective clinical tests. In addition to genetic mutation analysis, predictive chemosensitive assays using patient's cells will be carried out as a decision making tool. However, prior to their widespread application in clinics, several challenges linked to the establishment of such assays need to be addressed. To best predict the drug response in a patient, the cellular environment needs to resemble that of the tumor. Furthermore, the formation of homogeneous replicates from a scarce amount of patient's cells is essential to compare the responses under various conditions (compound and concentration). Here, we present a microfluidic device for homogeneous spheroid formation in eight replicates in a perfused microenvironment. Spheroid replicates from either a cell line or primary cells from adenocarcinoma patients were successfully created. To further mimic the tumor microenvironment, spheroid co-culture of primary lung cancer epithelial cells and primary pericytes were tested. A higher chemoresistance in primary co-culture spheroids compared to primary monoculture spheroids was found when both were constantly perfused with cisplatin. This result is thought to be due to the barrier created by the pericytes around the tumor spheroids. Thus, this device can be used for additional chemosensitivity assays (e.g. sequential treatment) of patient material to further approach the personalized oncology field.",

Genotypic variation in CYP2D6 affects endoxifen levels, and some have argued that patients who do not efficiently metabolize tamoxifen might wish to consider alternative hormonal treatments. This study evaluated an algorithm in which endoxifen levels and CYP2D6 genotypes were used to make hormonal therapy recommendations for patients on adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer. Patients with stage I-III breast cancer who had been taking adjuvant tamoxifen for 8-56\u00a0weeks were eligible. At enrollment, baseline whole blood and serum were sent for genotyping by Amplichip and endoxifen measurement, respectively, and endoxifen levels were also measured 3\u00a0weeks later. Results were returned to oncologists along with an algorithm-generated treatment recommendation. The algorithm recommended that participants with poor metabolizer genotype and/or baseline endoxifen level <6\u00a0ng/mL consider alternative endocrine therapy. A medical record review evaluated actual treatment decisions. Of 99 patients on study, 18 (18\u00a0%) had findings that triggered algorithm-based recommendations to consider a change in endocrine therapy due to endoxifen <6\u00a0ng/mL (all 18 patients) and/or poor metabolizer CYP2D6 genotype (2 of the 18). Endoxifen levels were \u22656\u00a0ng/mL in four of them 3\u00a0weeks later. Seven (39\u00a0% of 18) switched to a different treatment (one based on toxicity, not the algorithm). Hot flash burden was not found to be significantly associated with endoxifen <6\u00a0ng/mL or genotype. Prospective testing of tamoxifen metabolism as gauged by CYP2D6 genotype and serum endoxifen levels is feasible. Future studies of tamoxifen metabolism and efficacy should consider including measurement of serial endoxifen levels. Although clinical evidence at present is insufficient to warrant routine CYP2D6 or endoxifen testing, some clinicians and patients did utilize this predefined algorithm to inform clinical decisions regarding optimal adjuvant endocrine therapy.",

The personalization is applied to the digital newspaper domain and it used a user-model that stores long and short term interests using four reference systems: sections, categories, keywords and feedback terms. On the other side, it is crucial to measure how much information is lost during the summarization process, and how this information loss may affect the ability of the user to judge the relevance of a given document.

Recent advances in MABs show that their efficacy depends strongly on characterization of tumor biomarkers. Therefore, one of the main tasks in cancer diagnostics and treatment is to develop non-invasive in-vivo imaging techniques for detection of cancer biomarkers and monitoring their down regulation during the treatment. Such methods can potentially result in a new imaging and treatment paradigm for cancer therapy. In this article we have reviewed fluorescence imaging approaches, including those developed in our group, to detect and monitor Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (HER2) receptors before and during therapy. Transition of these techniques from the bench to bedside is the ultimate goal of our project. Similar approaches can be used potentially for characterization of other cancer related cell biomarkers.",

However, in various applications, a record (e.g., hotel) maybe rated on several attributes (value, service, etc.), in which case simply returning the ones with the highest overall scores fails to capture the individual attribute characteristics and to accommodate different selection criteria. In order to enhance the flexibility of CF, we propose Collaborative Filtering Skyline (CFS), a general framework that combines the advantages of CF with those of the skyline operator. CFS generates a personalized skyline for each user based on scores of other users with similar behavior. The personalized skyline includes objects that are good on certain aspects, and eliminates the ones that are not interesting on any attribute combination. Although the integration of skylines and CF has several attractive properties, it also involves rather expensive computations. We face this challenge through a comprehensive set of algorithms and optimizations that reduce the cost of generating personalized skylines. In addition to exact skyline processing, we develop an approximate method that provides error guarantees. Finally, we propose the top-k personalized skyline, where the user specifies the required output cardinality.",

        "abstract": "The notion of personalized medicine has developed from the application of the discipline of pharmacogenetics to clinical medicine. Although the clinical relevance of genetically-determined inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetics is poorly understood, and the genotype-phenotype association data on clinical outcomes often inconsistent, officially approved drug labels frequently include pharmacogenetic information concerning the safety and/or efficacy of a number of drugs and refer to the availability of the pharmacogenetic test concerned. Regulatory authorities differ in their approach to these issues. Evidence emerging subsequently has generally revealed the pharmacogenetic information included in the label to be premature. Revised drugs labels, together with a flurry of other collateral activities, have raised public expectations of personalized medicine, promoted as 'the right drug at the right dose the first time.' These expectations place the prescribing physician in a dilemma and at risk of litigation, especially when evidence-based information on genotype-related dosing schedules is to all intent and purposes non-existent and guidelines, intended to improve the clinical utility of available pharmacogenetic information or tests, distance themselves from any responsibility. Lack of efficacy or an adverse drug reaction is frequently related to non-genetic factors. Phenoconversion, arising from drug interactions, poses another often neglected challenge to any potential success of personalized medicine by mimicking genetically-determined enzyme deficiency. A more realistic promotion of personalized medicine should acknowledge current limitations and emphasize that pharmacogenetic testing can only improve the likelihood of diminishing a specific toxic effect or increasing the likelihood of a beneficial effect and that application of pharmacogenetics to clinical medicine cannot adequately predict drug response in individual patients.",

Aiming to reduce this gap, this chapter provides an overview of the science driving personalized medicine, outlines areas of research and clinical translation where nurses may expect to see its fruits, and briefly identifies obstacles preventing its full realization. Four scientific elements of personalized medicine are described: (1) discovery of novel biology that guides clinical translation mechanisms, (2) genetic risk assessment, (3) molecular diagnostic technology, and (4) pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Successful design and implementation of Personalized Medicine will hinge on the roles of nurses conducting or participating in collaborative initiatives that are furthering genetic/genomic applications within these contexts.",

To prevent relapses, personalized treatment strategies are currently being developed, which target specific molecular aberrations. To determine relevance of established AML type I/II mutations that may serve as therapeutic targets, we assessed frequencies of these mutations and their persistence during disease progression in a large group (n = 69) of paired diagnosis and relapse pediatric AML specimens. In 26 of 42 patients (61%) harboring mutations at either stage of the disease, mutation status changed between diagnosis and relapse, particularly in FLT3, WT1, and RAS genes. Presence or gain of type I/II mutations at relapse was associated with a shorter time to relapse (TTR), whereas absence or loss correlated with longer TTR. Moreover, an adverse outcome was found for patients with activating mutations at relapse, which was statistically significant for FLT3/ITD and WT1 mutations. These findings suggest that mutational shifts affect disease progression. We hence propose that risk stratification, malignant cell detection, and selection of personalized treatment should be based on status of type I/II mutations both at initial diagnosis and during follow-up.",

The association of biomarkers and psoriasis is helpful to evaluate susceptibility to the disease, its severity and its progression. Additionally, the response to treatment will be anticipated. The growing expenses of health care systems worldwide are primarily due to increasing costs of chronic disease management. Hence, activation of preventive medicine will minimize treatment costs. A revolution in treatment modalities is expected to start at the level of pharmaceutical companies, as personalization of medicine will decrease the cost of clinical trials by minimizing the number of subjects required. In turn, this will decrease the cost of developing new medications.

Cancer arises from changes in the DNA sequence in the genomes of cancer cells. These accelerating somatic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways, including EGFR, Wnt/Notch, Hedgehog and others, with a central role in cell growth, proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. All of these genetic alterations can now be discovered using next-generation DNA sequencing technology. This high-throughput technology can achieve two major goals: first, to complete the catalogue of driver mutations, including point mutations, rearrangements and copy-number changes, by full and targeted sequencing; and second, to explore the functional role of cancer genes and their interactions by genome-wide RNA, serial analysis of gene expression, microRNAs, protein-DNA interactions, and comprehensive analyses of transcriptomes and interactomes. This review article discusses the challenges, including costs, in completing the catalogue of driver mutations for each cancer type and understanding how cancer genomes operate as whole biological systems. Now high-quality clinical treatment and outcomes (death or survival) data from biobanks, and extensive genetics and genomics data for some common tumors, including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, are available. In this article, we will describe how all these clinical and genetics data could be integrated into reverse engineering-based network modeling to approach the extremely complex genotype-phenotype map. This clinico-genome systems model, published for the first time, opens the way for the discovery of new molecular innovations, both predictive markers and therapies, towards personalized treatment of cancer. Instead of the comparative-effectiveness research or personalized medicine debate, harmonization of both can revolutionize cancer management.",

        "abstract": "One of the necessary conditions to perform any personalized medicine is to obtain good individual predictions. In addition to the numerous markers available (omics data), the methods used to analyze the data are very important too. We are presenting an example of mathematical dynamical mechanistic model that could be used for adapting the antiretroviral treatment in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus. The interest of this type of approach is to build a model based on biological knowledge about the interaction between markers and therefore to allow for a better predictive power.",

        "abstract": "To develop personalized medicine strategies for improvement of patient management in rheumatoid arthritis, the clinical and molecular properties of the individual patients need to be well characterized. A crucial step in this approach is to discover subgroups of patients that are characterized by a good or poor treatment outcome. Dennis and colleagues have identified distinct pretreatment gene expression profiles in affected synovial tissue specimens and a tissue type-related systemic protein pattern which are associated with a positive or negative clinical outcome to monotherapy with adalumimab (anti-TNF\u03b1) and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor). These observations assign biological pathways associated with response outcome and provide evidence for the existence of systemic,easy-to-measure predictive biomarkers for clinical benefit of these biologics.",

Of the many risk factors for chronicity, the most relevant are psychosocial and occupational. Identifying homogeneous patient subgroups helps to develop personalized treatment strategies, thus improving the outcomes. Current clinical research is focusing on subgroup identification via simple validated questionnaires that are suitable for use in everyday practice. We suggest a management approach leading from the individual patient profile to the treatment strategy.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the efficacy of two brief personalized feedback interventions (PFIs) using identical feedback and motivational interviewing strategies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems to two control conditions among a sample of high-risk drinking college students. Students (N = 152) were randomly assigned to a computer-delivered PFI with a video interviewer, a face-to-face PFI with a live interviewer, a comprehensive assessment condition, or a minimal assessment-only condition. At 10 weeks posttreatment, the face-to-face PFI significantly reduced weekly drinking quantity and peak and typical blood alcohol concentration compared with the comprehensive assessment and minimal assessment-only conditions (d values ranged from 0.32 to 0.61). No significant between-group differences were evidenced for the computer-delivered PFI condition, although effect sizes were comparable to other college drinking studies using computer-delivered interventions (d values ranged from 0.20 to 0.27). Results provide further support for the use of a face-to-face PFI to help reduce college students' alcohol consumption and suggest that a video interviewer in the context of a computer-delivered PFI is likely a helpful but not necessarily a complete substitute for a live interviewer. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",
