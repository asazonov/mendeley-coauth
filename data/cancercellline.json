        "abstract": "Production of biological (protein)-based therapeutics offers fundamental challenges. The ability to generate unique life-saving\\r  therapies has been engaged by many commercial concerns, mainly using eukaryotic (mammalian) cell culture platforms. Genes\\r  encoding the valuable biopharmaceuticals are introduced into the host cell where they integrate into the cellular genome.\\r  What goes on within the nucleus is no longer a black box but it has become clear over the last decade that we have not yet\\r  begun to fully appreciate the complexity of this sub-cellular compartment and there remains significant scope to further optimise\\r  this stage of commercial bioprocessing. This review highlights the current vision of the eukaryotic nucleus in relation to\\r  its role as the controller of expression of genes that are introduced for production of a desired product. The layers of interwoven\\r  complexity \u2013 eu- and hetero-chromatin, epigenetic marking of genes and genomes, nucleosomes, expression factories and chromosome\\r  territories \u2013 will be described. As this knowledge base has accumulated it has led to the use of approaches that seek to maximise\\r  the expression of introduced genes, using a rationalised understanding of nuclear architecture and higher level genome regulation.\\r  \\r  The past decade has seen step-changes in our perception of the eukaryotic nucleus in terms of structural environments and,\\r  consequently, the potential for previously unconsidered modes of regulation of gene expression. Driven by technological developments,\\r  that have permitted increased understanding of nuclear structure, we perceive that there are layers of complexity in eukaryotic\\r  transcription control that may have the potential to either thwart or enhance cell gene engineering. The existence of regulation\\r  at the level of nuclear structure and genomic environment has relevance to approaches that utilise eukaryotic cells as hosts\\r  for expression of exogenous genes (as in the use of mammalian cells as \u201cfactories\u201d for production of biopharmaceuticals).\\r  This level of regulation has consequences for the extent and stability of expression of genes introduced into cells (either\\r  genes that encode for the desired biopharmaceutical or genes encoding for proteins predicted to enhance the \u201cfactory\u201d activity\\r  of the cell) and for endogenous cellular genes (for which expression may be modified in response to incorporation of foreign\\r  genes into specific areas of the genomic environment, with potential consequences for cellular function).\\r  \\r  \\r  \\r  This review will highlight current understanding of the structural relationships between chromosomes, genes and the physical\\r  entity that comprises the eukaryotic nucleus. Current perceptions have been developed from information obtained from a number\\r  of experimental eukaryotic systems. After describing the generic model for relationships between nuclear structure and gene\\r  regulation, I will discuss the implications for production of biopharmaceuticals in relation to commercially-relevant eukaryotic\\r  cells (predominantly Chinese Hamster ovary, CHO, and NS0 myeloma). Within this context there are very clear linkages between\\r  our increasing understanding of genomic environment and current developments related to incorporation of specific DNA sequences\\r  within expression vectors for use with mammalian cell lines (Chapter 1, this volume). This will be discussed, as appropriate,\\r  along with the forward vision of how information on genomic environment may be used for further rationalised optimisation\\r  of future expression platforms."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insensitivity of advanced-stage prostate cancer to androgen ablation therapy is a serious problem in clinical practice because it is associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis. Targeted therapeutic drug discovery efforts are thwarted by lack of adequate knowledge of gene(s) associated with prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore there is the need for studies to provide leads to targeted intervention measures. Here we propose that stable expression of U94, a tumor suppressor gene encoded by human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A), could alter gene expression and thereby inhibit the tumorigenicity of PC3 cell line. Microarray gene expression profiling on U94 recombinant PC3 cell line could reveal genes that would elucidate prostate cancer biology, and hopefully identify potential therapeutic targets.\\n\\nRESULTS: We have shown that stable expression of U94 gene in PC3 cell line inhibited its focus formation in culture, and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Moreover gene expression profiling revealed dramatic upregulation of FN 1 (fibronectin, 91 +/- 16-fold), and profound downregulation of ANGPTL 4 (angiopoietin-like-4, 20 +/- 4-fold) in U94 recombinant PC3 cell line. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis showed that the pattern of expression of FN 1 and ANGPTL 4 mRNA were consistent with the microarray data. Based on previous reports, the findings in this study implicate upregulation of FN 1 and downregulation of ANGPTL 4 in the anti tumor activity of U94. Genes with cancer inhibitory activities that were also upregulated include SERPINE 2 (serine/cysteine protease inhibitor 2, 7 +/- 1-fold increase) and ADAMTS 1 (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 7 +/- 2-fold increase). Additionally, SPUVE 23 (serine protease 23) that is pro-tumorigenic was significantly downregulated (10 +/- 1-fold).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The dramatic upregulation of FN 1 and downregulation of ANGPTL 4 genes in PC3 cell line stably expressing U94 implicate up-regulation of FN 1 and downregulation of ANGPTL 4 in anti tumor activity of U94. Further studies are necessary to determine functional roles of differentially expressed genes in U94 recombinant PC3 cell line, and hopefully provide leads to potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer."

Some studies have demonstrated that side population (SP) cells isolated from diverse cancer lines harbor cancer stem-like properties, but there are few reports examining the characteristic of SP cells in human cervical cancer. The aim of this study is 1) to find out a feasible way to detect the tumor stem-like cells in cervical cancer, and 2) to analyze the properties of the SP cells being sorted.\\n\\nMETHODS: Isolated SP and non-SP cells from human cervical cancer cell line Hela by Hoechst 33342 dying method and flow cytometry analysis. Observing morphology of SP and non-SP cells. The expression of various biomarkers putatively related to cancer stem cells were investigated by immucytochemistry of SP and non-SP cells. We also analyzed cell cycle and cell apoptosis for sorted cells. The oncogenicity of the SP and non-SP cells were analyzed by tumor formation in nonobesediabeti- c/severe combined immune- deficient (NOD/SCID) mice. The drug-resistant and radiation-resistant index between SP, non-SP and Hela cells was estimated by MTS assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: The fraction of SP cells in Hela was approximately 1.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32%. SP cells were smaller and rounder in shape than non-SP cells, and mostly showed colony-like growth. Immunocytochemistry showed that stem cell makers (Oct3/4, CD133, BCRP) were highly expressed in SP cells. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells among non-SP cells (17.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7%) was significantly higher compared with that among SP cells (4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2%). The HE staining of in vivo grown tumors result from SP cells showed more poor differentiation, though no significant differences were shown between SP and non-SP cells in NOD/SCID mice tumorigenicity. Furthermore, SP cells demonstrated a higher degree of drug resistance against trichostatin A (TSA) compared with that of non-SP and Hela cells. SP cells were also found to be more resistant against radiotherapy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: SP cells possess some characteristics of CSCs, namely high proliferation ability, chemoresistance and radioresistance, which may be helpful to elucidate novel targets for effective clinical treatments of cervical cancer in the future."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal form of locally invasive breast cancer known. However, very little information is available on the cellular mechanisms responsible for manifestation of the IBC phenotype. To understand the unique phenotype of IBC, we compared the motile and adhesive interactions of an IBC cell line, SUM 149, to the non-IBC cell line SUM 102. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that both IBC and non-IBC cell lines exhibit similar adhesive properties to basal lamina, but SUM 149 showed a marked increase in adhesion to collagen I. In vitro haptotaxis assays demonstrate that SUM 149 was less invasive, while wound healing assays show a less in vitro migratory phenotype for SUM 149 cells relative to SUM 102 cells. We also demonstrate a role for Rho and E-cadherin in the unique invasive phenotype of IBC. Immunoblotting reveals higher E-cadherin and RhoA expression in the IBC cell line but similar RhoC expression. Rhodamine phalloidin staining demonstrates increased formation of actin stress fibers and larger focal adhesions in SUM 149 relative to the SUM 102 cell line. CONCLUSION: The observed unique actin and cellular architecture as well as the invasive and adhesive responses to the extracellular matrix of SUM 149 IBC cells suggest that the preference of IBC cells for connective tissue, possibly a mediator important for the vasculogenic mimicry via tubulogenesis seen in IBC pathological specimens. Overexpression of E-cadherin and RhoA may contribute to passive dissemination of IBC by promoting cell-cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal structures that maintain tissue integrity. Therefore, we believe that these findings indicate a passive metastatic mechanism by which IBC cells invade the circulatory system as tumor emboli rather than by active migratory mechanisms."

Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antibiotic is one of the most effective anticancer agents used to treat breast cancer. chronic cardiotoxicity is a major limiting factor of the use of doxorubicin. Therefore, our study was designed to assess the role of a natural product resveratrol (RSVL) on sensitization of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) to the action of DOX in an attempt to minimize doxorubicin effective dose and thereby its side effects.\\n\\nMETHODS: Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, was used in this study. Cytotoxic activity of DOX was determined using (sulforhodamine) SRB method. Apoptotic cells were quantified after treatment by annexin V-FITC- propidium iodide (PI) double staining using flow-cytometer. Cell cycle disturbance and doxorubicin uptake were determined after RSVL or DOX treatment.\\n\\nRESULTS: Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 15 \u03bcg/ml RSVL either simultaneously or 24 h before DOX increased the cytotoxicity of DOX, with IC50 were 0.056 and 0.035 \u03bcg/ml, respectively compared to DOX alone IC50 (0.417 \u03bcg/ml). Moreover, flow cytometric analysis of the MCF-7 cells treated simultaneously with DOX (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) and RSVL showed enhanced arrest of the cells in G0 (80%). On the other hand, when RSVL is given 24 h before DOX although there was more increased in the cytotoxic effect of DOX against the growth of the cells, however, there was decreased in percentage arrest of cells in G0, less inhibition of DOX-induced apoptosis and reduced DOX cellular uptake into the cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: RSVL treatment increased the cytotoxic activity of DOX against the growth of human breast cancer cells when given either simultaneously or 24 h before DOX."

Moreover, 5-Aza-CdR treatment induced A549DDP cell apoptosis in a dose dependent manner with declining cell percentage in S and G2/M stage, and increasing proportion in G0/G1 stage.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor that has been reported to reduce the risk of breast cancer. In our previous study, celecoxib induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and its effects were mediated by downregulation of NF-\u03baB signaling. The NF-\u03baB p65/RelA subunit may play a role in cell death through the activation of anti-apoptotic target genes including the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Bcl-2 families, and inhibition of protein kinase B/Akt. The aim of the present study was to investigate p65 as the potential target of celecoxib treatment and determine whether p65 overexpression can override the inhibitory effect of celecoxib on NF-\u03baB activity and affect cell survival.\\n\\nMETHODS: The effects of p65 overexpression on celecoxib-inhibited NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity were examined by western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell viability and cell death were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay, and the levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase. Anti-apoptotic NF-\u03baB target genes and cell cycle regulators were examined by western blotting to screen for the expression of target genes under direct regulation by p65.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overexpression of p65 increased NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity and interfered with celecoxib-mediated apoptosis as assessed by MTT assay and caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP expressions. Exogenously overexpressed p65 upregulated NF-\u03baB-responsive genes, including anti-apoptotic genes such as survivin and XIAP, and the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin D1. However, p65 overexpression did not affect celecoxib-induced p-Akt inactivation, suggesting that celecoxib might have separate molecular mechanisms for regulating Akt signaling independently of its inhibition of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: p65 is a pivotal anti-apoptotic factor that can reverse celecoxib-induced growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously reported the usefulness of the alphaGal epitope as a target molecule for gene therapy against cancer. To induce cancer cell specific transcription of the alphaGal epitope, an expression vector which synthesizes the alphaGal epitope under the control of a promoter region of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), NK7, was constructed. METHODS: NK7 was transfected into a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, MIA cells, and telomerase-negative SUSM-1 cells served controls. Expression of the alphaGal epitope was confirmed by flow cytometry using IB4 lectin. The susceptibility of transfected MIA cells to human natural antibodies, was examined using a complement-dependent cytotoxic cross-match test (CDC) and a flow cytometry using annexin V. RESULTS: The alphaGal epitope expression was detected only on the cell surfaces of NK7-transfected MIA cells, i.e., not on naive MIA cells or telomerase negative SUSM-1 cells. The CDC results indicated that MIA cells transfected with NK7 are susceptible to human natural antibody-mediated cell killing, and the differences, as compared to NK-7 transfected telomerase negative SUSM-1 cells or telomerase positive naive MIA cells, were statistically significant. The flow cytometry using annexin V showed a higher number of the apoptotic cells in NK-7 transfected MIA cells than in naive MIA cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that alphaGal epitope-expression, under the control of the hTERT-promoter, may be useful in cancer specific gene therapy."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic phenomenon known to play an important role in the development of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Aberrant methylation of promoter regions of genes is potentially reversible, and if methylation is important for cancer survival, demethylation should do the opposite. To test this we have addressed the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), decytabine and zebularine, potentiate inhibitory effects of classical anti-CRC cytostatics, oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), on survival of CRC cells in vitro. RESULTS: Isobole and median effect analysis revealed that decytabine shows potent synergistic interaction with oxaliplatin and 5-FU and that this is probably not the class effect of DNMTi as zebularine shows strong antagonistic interaction with oxaliplatin. The synergistic combination treatment was also applied to the cultures to investigate their mechanisms of action. We have shown that combinations of decytabine with cytostatics produced dose-dependent growth inhibition and treatment-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The observed synergism between decytabine and cytostatics is most probably related to the augmented apoptotic signal and allowed for significant (both biologically and statistically) reduction of the cytotoxic doses of cytostatics used."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The synergic action of KHCO3 and D-ribose is tested on A72 and HTB-126 cell lines proliferation using K:D-Rib solution. Altered Na+/K+ ATPase expression and activity were shown in patients with cancer. Studies in human epithelial-derived malignancies indicate that K+ depletion also occurs, contributing to the increased intracellular Na+/K+ ratio 1. D-ribose transformed to piruvate, enters into the Krebs's cycle and has a key role on energetic metabolism. The up-regulation of glycolysis in tumor cells is already well known and it is the rationale of F18-FDG PET diagnostic technique. D-ribose is synthesized by the non-oxidative transketolase PPP reaction.\\n\\nRESULTS: Results with different K:D-Rib concentrations show that MTT salt interferes with K:D-Rib solution and therefore this method is not reliable. The UV/VIS measurements show that K:D-Rib solutions reduce MTT salt to formazan in absence of cells. Cell proliferation has then been evaluated analysing the digital photos of the Giemsa stained cells with MCID\u2122 software. At 5 mM K:D-Rib concentration, the cell growth arrests between 48 h and 72 h; in fact the cell number after 48 h is around the same with respect to the control after 72 h. In case of HTB-126 human cancer cells, the growth rate was valuated counting the splitting times during 48 days: control cells were split sixteen times while 5 mM treated cells eleven times. Most relevant, the clonogenic assay shows that nine colonies are formed in the control cells while only one is formed in the 5 mM and none in 10 mM treated cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The K:D-Rib solution has an antioxidant behaviour also at low concentrations. Incubation with 5 mM K:D-Rib solution on A72 cells shows a cytostatic effect at 5 mM, but it needs more than 24 h of incubation time to evidence this effect on cell proliferation. At the same concentration on human HTB-126 cells, K:D-Rib solution shows a clear replication slowing but the cytostatic effect at 10 mM K:D-Rib solution only. Results on A72 cells indicate the K+ uptake could be determinant either to arrest or to slow down cell growth."

        "abstract": "Background: Styrylpyrone derivative (SPD) is a plant-derived pharmacologically active compound extracted from Goniothalamus sp. Previously, we have reported that SPD inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptotic cell death, while having minimal effects on non-malignant cells. Here, we attempt to further elucidate the mode of action of SPD. Results: We found that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was invoked, with the accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c and processing of the initiator caspase-9. Cleaved products of procaspase-8 were not detected. Next, the executioner caspase-7 was cleaved and activated in response to SPD treatment. To confirm that apoptosis was induced following caspase-7 activation, the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO was used. Pre-incubation of cells with this inhibitor reversed apoptosis levels and caspase-7 activity in SPD-treated cells to untreated levels. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest SPD as a potent antiproliferative agent on MCF-7 cells by inducing apoptosis in a caspase-7-dependent manner."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The voltage gated potassium (K+) channels Eag and HERG have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers, through association with cell cycle changes and programmed cell death. The role of these channels in the onset and progression of ovarian cancer is unknown. An understanding of mechanism by which Eag and HERG channels affect cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells is required and therefore we investigated their role in cell proliferation and their effect on the cell cycle and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: The presence of Eag and HERG was determined in SK-OV-3 cells using immunofluorescence and western blotting. The effect of the Eag blockers (imipramine and clofilium) and HERG blockers (E-4031 and ergtoxin) on cell proliferation was assessed using the MTS assay with further investigation of their role in the cell cycle and apoptosis determined by flow cytometry.\\n\\nRESULTS: Eag and HERG channels were present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of SK-OV-3 cells. There was significant inhibition of proliferation of SK-OV-3 cells by imipramine (P < 0.001) and ergtoxin (P < 0.05) at 72 hours of culture. Incubation of cells with ergtoxin led to the accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phase, while cells accumulated in S phase after incubation with E-4031, with no effect on apoptosis. Imipramine did not affect the cell cycle but increased the proportion of SK-OV-3 cells undergoing early apoptosis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Both Eag and HERG channels are expressed in SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells and have a role in cell proliferation. HERG channels affect the cell cycle while Eag channels are implicated in the inhibition of apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. The family of Eag channels may represent a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), Alu and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) make up some 45% of human DNA. LINE-1 also called L1, is the most common family of non-LTR retrotransposons in the human genome and comprises about 17% of the genome. L1 elements require the integration into chromosomal target sites using L1-encoded endonuclease which creates staggering DNA breaks allowing the newly transposed L1 copies to integrate into the genome. L1 expression and retrotransposition in cancer cells might cause transcriptional deregulation, insertional mutations, DNA breaks, and an increased frequency of recombinations, contributing to genome instability. There is however little evidence on the mechanism of L1-induced genetic instability and its impact on cancer cell growth and proliferation. RESULTS: We report that L1 has genome-destabilizing effects indicated by an accumulation of gamma-H2AX foci, an early response to DNA strand breaks, in association with an abnormal cell cycle progression through a G2/M accumulation and an induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that adjuvant L1 activation may lead to supra-additive killing when combined with radiation by enhancing the radiation lethality through induction of apoptosis that we have detected through Bax activation. CONCLUSION: L1 retrotransposition is sensed as a DNA damaging event through the creation DNA breaks involving L1-encoded endonuclease. The apparent synergistic interaction between L1 activation and radiation can further be utilized for targeted induction of cancer cell death. Thus, the role of retrotransoposons in general, and of L1 in particular, in DNA damage and repair assumes larger significance both for the understanding of mutagenicity and, potentially, for the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process implicated in cancer metastasis that involves the conversion of epithelial cells to a more mesenchymal and invasive cell phenotype. In breast cancer cells EMT is associated with altered store-operated calcium influx and changes in calcium signalling mediated by activation of cell surface purinergic receptors. In this study, we investigated whether MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells induced to undergo EMT exhibit changes in mRNA levels of calcium channels, pumps and exchangers located on intracellular calcium storing organelles, including the Golgi, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\\n\\nMETHODS: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was used to induce EMT in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Serum-deprived cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/mL) for 12 h and gene expression was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR.\\n\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal no significant alterations in mRNA levels of the Golgi calcium pump secretory pathway calcium ATPases (SPCA1 and SPCA2), or the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) or Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX). However, EGF-induced EMT was associated with significant alterations in mRNA levels of specific ER calcium channels and pumps, including (sarco)-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCAs), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RYR) calcium channel isoforms. The most prominent change in gene expression between the epithelial and mesenchymal-like states was RYR2, which was enriched 45-fold in EGF-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. These findings indicate that EGF-induced EMT in breast cancer cells may be associated with major alterations in ER calcium homeostasis."

        "abstract": "Many cancers harbor oncogenic mutations of KRAS. Effectors mediating cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis in KRAS-mutated cancers are only incompletely understood. Here we identify cancer cell-expressed murine TRAIL-R, whose main function ascribed so far has been the induction of apoptosis as a crucial mediator of KRAS-driven cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis and invivo Rac-1 activation. Cancer cell-restricted genetic ablation of murine TRAIL-R in autochthonous KRAS-driven models of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reduces tumor growth, blunts metastasis, and prolongs survival by inhibiting cancer cell-autonomous migration, proliferation, and invasion. Consistent with this, high TRAIL-R2 expression correlates with invasion of human PDAC into lymph vessels and with shortened metastasis-free survival of KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer patients."

Furthermore, Dicer1 null cells from a sarcoma cell line, though depleted of miRNAs, are competent for tumor formation.

The \"aerobic glycolysis\" is known as the Warburg effect and it is considered one of the fundamental hallmarks of metabolic alteration during malignant transformation. A feature of many tumors is also a change into ions equilibrium, with particular reference to K(+) intracellular concentration. Another hallmark in cancer is the reprogrammed chemotaxis pathways in favour of tumor cell dissemination.\\n\\nRESULTS: The doubling population time of 5\u00a0mM\u00a0K:D-rib treated Hs 578T (HTB-126 \u00ae ATCC) cell line is reduce by 30% respect to the control. During the chemotactic invasion assay, the relative number of motile and invasive cells, counted inside the FBS-AGAR spot, shows a decrease with the maintenance of the treatment reaching the 25% after nine days. Hs 578Bst (HTB-125 \u00ae ATCC) non-tumor cell line treated for nineteen days with 5\u00a0mM\u00a0K:D-rib was split twice as well as the control. No morphological change was visible in the treated respect to untreated cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the synergic action of potassium bicarbonate and D-ribose has effect on Hs 578T cancer cell line proliferation reducing the cell cycle time. At 5\u00a0mM concentration, K:D-rib is able to modify the tumorigenic potential of human breast cancer cell line Hs 578T, interfering in vitro with the capability of Hs 578\u00a0T cell line to migrate under chemotactic stimuli. Despite this, K:D-rib solution, does not exhibit any appreciable toxicity as confirmed by the proliferation assay accomplished on Hs 578Bst cell line."

Iden-tifying and targeting critical pathways that improve therapeutic efficacy by bolstering anti-tumor immune responses holds great potential for improving outcomes and impacting long-term patient survival. Macro-phages are key regulators of homeostatic tissue and tumor microenvironments. Therefore, therapeutics im-pacting macrophage presence and/or bioactivity have shown promise in preclinical models and are now being evaluated in the clinic. This review discusses the molecular/cellular pathways identified so far whereby macrophages mediate therapeutic responses. Macrophages are represented in all tissues by functionally and phenotypically distinct resident populations that are critical for development and homeostasis (Wynn et al., 2013). Under non-pathological conditions, most resident macrophage populations derive from embryonic progenitors and are maintained through local proliferation (Epelman et al., 2014). Exceptions to this include intestinal, dermal, and alveolar macrophages at barrier sites (Bain et al., 2014; McGovern et al., 2014; Perdiguero et al., 2015; Yona et al., 2013) and macrophages in the adult heart that are replaced by circulating bone marrow-derived Ly6C + inflammatory monocytes over a timescale of several"

Cells were incubated with MTZ used in different concentrations for 24, 48, and 72 hours. The effect of MTZ on DNA synthesis was measured as [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The morphological changes in human DLD-1 cell line were defined by transmission electron microscope OPTON 900. The influence of MTZ on the apoptosis of DLD-1 cell lines was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, while cell concentration, volume, and diameter were displayed by Scepter Cell Counter from Millipore. Our results show that cell viability was diminished in all experimental groups in comparison with the control, and the differences were statistically significant. We did not find any significant differences in [3H]-thymidine incorporation in all experimental groups and times of observation. Cytofluorimetric assays demonstrated a statistically significant increase of apoptotic rate in MTZ concentrations 10 and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL after 24 hours; 0.1, 10, 50, and 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL after 48 hours; and in all concentrations after 72 hours compared with control groups. In the ultrastructural studies, necrotic or apoptotic cells were occasionally seen. In conclusion, MTZ affects human CRC cell line viability. The reduction of cell viability was consistent with the apoptotic test."

Immunocytochemical analysis of glial markers demonstrated that cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100 protein, and negative for vimentin. Under phase-contrast microscope, cultures of NG97 showed cells with variable morphological features, such as small rounded cells, fusiform cells (fibroblastic-like cells), and dendritic-like cells. However, at confluence just small rounded and fusiform cells can be observed. At scanning electron microscopy (SEM) small rounded cells showed heterogeneous microextentions, including blebs and filopodia. Dendritic-like cells were flat and presented extensive prolongations, making several contacts with small rounded cells, while fusiform cells presented their surfaces dominated by microvilli.We believe that the knowledge about NG97 cell line may be useful for a deeper understanding of biological and immunological characteristics of gliomas."

This metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect, provides tumor cells with the substrates required for biomass generation. Here, we show that the mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 is a crucial regulator of the Warburg effect. Mechanistically, SIRT3 mediates metabolic reprogramming by destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha), a transcription factor that controls glycolytic gene expression. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, leading to HIF1alpha stabilization. SIRT3 expression is reduced in human breast cancers, and its loss correlates with the upregulation of HIF1alpha target genes. Finally, we find that SIRT3 overexpression represses glycolysis and proliferation in breast cancer cells, providing a metabolic mechanism for tumor suppression."

Its activity can be negatively regulated by the phosphatase PHLPP that specifically dephosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt (Ser473 in Akt1). However, how PHLPP is targeted to Akt is not clear. Here we show that FKBP51 (FK506-binding protein 51) acts as a scaffolding protein for Akt and PHLPP and promotes dephosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, FKBP51 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissue samples and several cancer cell lines. Decreased FKBP51 expression in cancer cells results in hyperphosphorylation of Akt and decreased cell death following genotoxic stress. Overall, our findings identify FKBP51 as a negative regulator of the Akt pathway, with potentially important implications for cancer etiology and response to chemotherapy. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Among the first nutrients to be linked to cancer were methyl group containing nutrients including methionine. Methionine and its metabolic derivatives are essential components in several indispensable biological reactions including protein synthesis, polyamine synthesis, and many transmethylation reactions. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which methionine excess affects the proliferation and gene expression of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Cells were first grown in control medium; the medium was then replaced with either control or methionine-supplemented treatment media. We found that 5 and 10 g/L methionine significantly suppressed cell growth on day 1, and no further growth was detected after 3 d of treatment. Cell proliferation in the methionine treated group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Northern analysis revealed that expression of p53 in methionine-treated MCF-7 cells was approximately 70% lower than that of control cells. p53 is a key cell cycle regulatory protein that has been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic change found in a wide variety of malignancies, including cancer. This study shows that excess methionine (5 g/L) inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and down regulation of p53 is correlated with this inhibition. These findings may aid in the development of nutritional strategies for breast cancer therapy."

This metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect, provides tumor cells with the substrates required for biomass generation. Here, we show that the mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 is a crucial regulator of the Warburg effect. Mechanistically, SIRT3 mediates metabolic reprogramming by destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1?? (HIF1??), a transcription factor that controls glycolytic gene expression. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, leading to HIF1?? stabilization. SIRT3 expression is reduced in human breast cancers, and its loss correlates with the upregulation of HIF1?? target genes. Finally, we find that SIRT3 overexpression represses glycolysis and proliferation in breast cancer cells, providing a metabolic mechanism for tumor suppression. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Whether cancer cells are dependent on these abnormal epigenetic modifications remains elusive. We used experimental and bioinformatic approaches to unveil genomic regions that require DNA methylation for survival of cancer cells. First, we surveyed the residual DNA methylation profiles in cancer cells with highly impaired DNA methyltransferases. Then, we clustered these profiles according to their DNA methylation status in primary normal and tumor tissues. Finally, we used gene expression meta-analysis to identify regions that are dependent on DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing. We further showed experimentally that these genes must be silenced by DNA methylation for cancer cell survival, suggesting these are key epigenetic events associated with tumorigenesis. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc."

In general, the recurrent genomic and transcriptional characteristics of 51 breast cancer cell lines mirror those of 145 primary breast tumors, although some significant differences are documented. The cell lines that comprise the system also exhibit the substantial genomic, transcriptional, and biological heterogeneity found in primary tumors. We show, using Trastuzumab (Herceptin) monotherapy as an example, that the system can be used to identify molecular features that predict or indicate response to targeted therapies or other physiological perturbations."

The pathobiology of prostate cancer metastasis is not well understood and cell lines and animal models that recapitulate the complex nature of the disease are needed. Therefore, the goal of the study was to establish and characterize a new prostate cancer line derived from a dog with spontaneous prostate cancer. METHODS A new cell line (Leo) was derived from a dog with spontaneous prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry and PCR were used to characterize the primary prostate cancer and xenografts in nude mice. Subcutaneous tumor growth and metastases in nude mice were evaluated by bioluminescent imaging, radiography and histopathology. In vitro chemosensitivity of Leo cells to therapeutic agents was measured. RESULTS Leo cells expressed the secretory epithelial cytokeratins (CK)8, 18, and ductal cell marker, CK7. The cell line grew in vitro (over 75 passages) and was tumorigenic in the subcutis of nude mice. Following intracardiac injection, Leo cells metastasized to the brain, spinal cord, bone, and adrenal gland. The incidence of metastases was greatest to the central nervous system (80%) with a lower incidence to bone (20%) and the adrenal glands (16%). In vitro chemosensitivity assays demonstrated that Leo cells were sensitive to Velcade and an HDAC-42 inhibitor with IC50 concentrations of 1.9 nm and 0.95 mum, respectively. CONCLUSION The new prostate cancer cell line (Leo) will be a valuable model to investigate the mechanisms of the brain and bone metastases. 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc"

Comparative metabolomics and lipidomics demonstrated that acetate is used as a nutritional source by cancer cells in an ACSS2-dependent manner, and supplied a significant fraction of the carbon within the fatty acid and phospholipid pools. ACSS2 expression is upregulated under metabolically stressed conditions and ACSS2 silencing reduced the growth of tumor xenografts. ACSS2 exhibits copy-number gain in human breast tumors, and ACSS2 expression correlates with disease progression. These results signify a critical role for acetate consumption in the production of lipid biomass within the harsh tumor microenvironment."

In this study, we investigated the role of decorin in suppressing tumor aggressiveness and bone metastases. We used a metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, to show that decorin causes marked growth suppression bothin vitro and in vivo. A cytomegaloviral vector containing the decorin transgene caused greatly reduced cell growth, motility and observed metastases. Bone metastases were decreased by >90% upon decorin transfection. These results demonstrate a novel role for decorin in the reduction or prevention of tumor metastases in this breast cancer model and could eventually lead to improved therapies for metastatic breast cancer."

It is clear that many agents are involved at the various stages of this process, however, many aspects of the progression remain unclear. In the present study we compared the gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 with the high-potential peritoneal dissemination gastric cancer cell line MKN-45P, established from MKN-45. The supernatant of culture medium of MKN-45 cells or MKN-45P cells was collected, and the concentrations of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Transforming growth factor beta-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) proteins were measured using an enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) method. Invasion, wound healing and adhesion assays were performed in vitro to examine interstitial invasion, migration and adhesion in the gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 proteins in the culture media of the cell lines. The concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and MMP-2 protein in the culture supernatant of MKN-45P were significantly higher than those of MKN-45. Percent adhesion of MKN-45P was significantly higher than that of MKN-45 in the fibronectin-coated group. There was no significant difference in invasion or migration between MKN-45 and MKN-45P. COX-1 and COX-2 proteins were observed in both cell lines. These results suggested that secretion of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and MMP-2 from cancer cells, and adhesion of cancer cells to fibronectin, were related to the establishment of peritoneal dissemination."

        "abstract": "Background: Physiologic wound repair and tissue regeneration are associated with distinct cellular behaviors triggered by tissue damage. Normally quiescent stem cells proliferate to regenerate damaged tissue, while relatively immobile epithelial cells can transform into a motile, tissue invasive phenotype through a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These distinct cellular behaviors may have particular relevance to how cancer cells can be predicted to behave after treatments damaging a tumor. Presentation of the hypothesis: Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy trigger highly conserved wound healing pathways that: (1) facilitate the phenotypic transformation of surviving cancer cells into a highly mobile, metastatic phenotype through an EMT or epithelial-mesenchymal transition and (2) induce residual cancer stem cell proliferation. Testing the hypothesis: Tissue damage caused by cancer treatments will trigger the release of distinct cytokines with established roles in physiologic wound healing, EMT induction, and stem cell activation. They will be released rapidly after treatment and detectable in the patient's blood. Careful histologic evaluation of cancerous tissue before and after treatment will reveal cellular changes suggestive of EMT induction (down regulation of cytokeratin expression) and cancer stem cell enrichment (stem cell markers upregulated). Implications of the hypothesis: Cancer cells surviving treatment will be more capable of metastasis and resistant to conventional therapies than the pre-treatment population of cancer cells. These changes will develop rapidly after treatment and, in distinct contrast to selection pressures fostering such changes, be triggered by highly conserved wound repair signals released after tissue damage. This pattern of tissue (tumor) repair may be amenable to treatment intervention at the time it is upregulated."

        "abstract": "Experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that antioxidant food polyphenols could have antimitotic activities, interfering with cancer initiation, progression or mortality. Circulating polyphenols are far lower than the nominal value in foods. In the rare studies dealing with polyphenol bioavailability, it was noted that their active concentrations in the blood are <1 % of their food concentration. In the present study we investigated the effect of four polyphenols (resveratrol, and the flavonoids quercetin, catechin and epicatechin, major constituents of wine) in the hormone-sensitive human cancer cell line T47D, at concentrations compatible with their calculated plasma concentrations after ingestion of a moderate quantity of wine (nM or pM). Our results indicate that cell growth was decreased, with cells being arrested at the S phase of the cycle. In addition, we provide evidence of a bimodal modulation of the NO/NOS system, affecting its activity and transcription. We show that modulation of this system is sufficient to explain polyphenol action on this cell line. This result suggests a potential importance of wine ingestion and possibly the consumption of other polyphenol-rich dietary foods and drinks in the control of breast cancer cell growth. \u00a9 Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research 2005."

        "abstract": "While the number and identity of proteins expressed in a single human cell type is currently unknown, this fundamental question can be addressed by advanced mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Online liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution MS and MS/MS yielded 166 420 peptides with unique amino-acid sequence from HeLa cells. These peptides identified 10 255 different human proteins encoded by 9207 human genes, providing a lower limit on the proteome in this cancer cell line. Deep transcriptome sequencing revealed transcripts for nearly all detected proteins. We calculate copy numbers for the expressed proteins and show that the abundances of > 90% of them are within a factor 60 of the median protein expression level. Comparisons of the proteome and the transcriptome, and analysis of protein complex databases and GO categories, suggest that we achieved deep coverage of the functional transcriptome and the proteome of a single cell type."

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer cells frequently metastasize to the skeleton and induce extensive bone destruction. Cancer cells produce proteinases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the plasminogen activator system (PAS) which promote invasion of extracellular matrices, but whether these proteinases degrade bone matrix is unclear. To characterize the role that breast cancer cell proteinases play in bone degradation we compared the effects of three human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 with those of a normal breast epithelial cell line, HME. The cell lines were cultured atop radiolabelled matrices of either mineralized or non-mineralized bone or type I collagen, the principal organic constituent of bone. Results: The 3 breast cancer cell lines all produced significant degradation of the 3 collagenous extracellular matrices (ECMs) whilst the normal breast cell line was without effect. Breast cancer cells displayed an absolute requirement for serum to dissolve collagen. Degradation of collagen was abolished in plasminogen-depleted serum and could be restored by the addition of exogenous plasminogen. Localization of plasmin activity to the cell surface was critical for the degradation process as aprotinin, but not \u03b12 antiplasmin, prevented collagen dissolution. During ECM degradation breast cancer cell lines expressed urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and uPA receptor, and MMPs-1, -3, -9,-13, and -14. The normal breast epithelial cell line expressed low levels of MMPs-1, and -3, uPA and uPA receptor. Inhibitors of both the PAS (aprotinin and PA inhibitor-1) and MMPs (CT1166 and tisue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) blocked collagen degradation, demonstrating the requirement of both plasminogen activation and MMP activity for degradation. The activation of MMP-13 in human breast cancer cells was prevented by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but not by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, suggesting that plasmin activates MMP-13 directly. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that breast cancer cells dissolve type I collagen and that there is an absolute requirement for plasminogen activation and MMP activity in the degradation process."

Here we report that CUTL1 activity is associated with increased migration and invasiveness in numerous tumor cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identify CUTL1 as a transcriptional target of transforming growth factor ?? and a mediator of its promigratory effects. CUTL1 activates a transcriptional program regulating genes involved in cell motility, invasion, and extracellular matrix composition. CUTL1 expression is significantly increased in high-grade carcinomas and is inversely correlated with survival in breast cancer. This suggests that CUTL1 plays a central role in coordinating a gene expression program associated with cell motility and tumor progression. Copyright ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Among the first nutrients to be linked to cancer were methyl group containing nutrients including methionine. Methionine and its metabolic derivatives are essential components in several indispensable biological reactions including protein synthesis, polyamine synthesis, and many transmethylation reactions. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which methionine excess affects the proliferation and gene expression of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Cells were first grown in control medium; the medium was then replaced with either control or methionine-supplemented treatment media. We found that 5 and 10 g/L methionine significantly suppressed cell growth on day 1, and no further growth was detected after 3 d of treatment. Cell proliferation in the methionine treated group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Northern analysis revealed that expression of p53 in methionine-treated MCF-7 cells was approximately 70% lower than that of control cells. p53 is a key cell cycle regulatory protein that has been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic change found in a wide variety of malignancies, including cancer. This study shows that excess methionine (5 g/L) inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and down regulation of p53 is correlated with this inhibition. These findings may aid in the development of nutritional strategies for breast cancer therapy."

Equal amounts of protein from each cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and were blotted on an Immobilon P membrane. Cadherins were immunodetected using anti-pan cadherin mAb and lectin blotting assays were performed, in parallel. N-oligosaccharides were analysed by specific reaction with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA), Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), Aleuria aurantia agglutinin (AAA), Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA-L) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The cadherin from HCV29 cell line possessed bi- and/or 2,4-branched triantennary complex type glycans, some of which were alpha2,6-sialylated. The cadherin from BC3726 cell line exhibited exclusively high mannose type glycans. Cadherins from Hu456 and T24 cell lines expressed high mannose type glycans as well as beta1,6-branched oligosaccharides with poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures and alpha2,3-linked sialic acid residues. Additionally, the presence of fucose and alpha2,6-sialic acid residues on the cadherin from T24 cell line was detected.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that N-glycosylation pattern of cadherin from bladder cancer cell line undergoes modification during carcinogenesis."

Here we identify a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for two Ras-driven cancers: Nf1-deficient malignancies and Kras/p53 mutant lung cancer. We show that agents that enhance proteotoxic stress, including the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504, induce tumor regression in aggressive mouse models, but only when combined with rapamycin. These agents synergize by promoting irresolvable ER stress, resulting in catastrophic ER and mitochondrial damage. This process is fueled by oxidative stress, which is caused by IPI-504-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, and the rapamycin-dependent suppression of glutathione, an important endogenous antioxidant. Notably, the mechanism by which these agents cooperate reveals a therapeutic paradigm that can be expanded to develop additional combinations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

MTT assay and clonogenic survival assay were used to measure the cisplatin sensitivity. FACS and host cell (CAT) reactivation assay were used to estimate the change of cell cycle and ability of repairing cisplatin-induced DNA damage. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nParental A2780 and A2780-V had similar cisplatin sensitivities, whereas A2780-MDM2 was two- to threefold more sensitive to cisplatin. Repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage was reduced in A2780 cells overexpressing MDM2, compared to A2780 cells in which wild-type p53 function was intact. After cisplatin treatment, A2780-MDM2 cells showed a pronounced S-phase arrest; however, A2780 cells with intact wild-type p53 arrested primarily in G2/M phase. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nMDM2 overexpression can increase cisplatin cytotoxicity in A2780, with loss of G1/S checkpoint control and decreased cisplatin\u2013DNA adduct repair. This suggests that ovarian cancers that overexpress MDM2 may be amenable to treatment with platinum compounds."

To shed light on signaling network topology in specific contexts, such as cancer, requires interrogation of multiple proteins through time and statistical approaches to make inferences regarding network structure.Results: In this study, we use dynamic Bayesian networks to make inferences regarding network structure and thereby generate testable hypotheses. We incorporate existing biology using informative network priors, weighted objectively by an empirical Bayes approach, and exploit a connection between variable selection and network inference to enable exact calculation of posterior probabilities of interest. The approach is computationally efficient and essentially free of user-set tuning parameters. Results on data where the true, underlying network is known place the approach favorably relative to existing approaches. We apply these methods to reverse-phase protein array time-course data from a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) to predict signaling links that we independently validate using targeted inhibition.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environment inside even a small tumor is characterized by total (anoxia) or partial oxygen deprivation, (hypoxia). It has been shown that radiotherapy and some conventional chemotherapies may be less effective in hypoxia, and therefore it is important to investigate how different drugs act in different microenvironments. In this study we perform a large screening of the effects of 19 clinically used or experimental chemotherapeutic drugs on five different cell lines in conditions of normoxia, hypoxia and anoxia. METHODS: A panel of 19 commercially available drugs: 5-fluorouracil, acriflavine, bortezomib, cisplatin, digitoxin, digoxin, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, gemcitabine, irinotecan, melphalan, mitomycin c, rapamycin, sorafenib, thalidomide, tirapazamine, topotecan and vincristine were tested for cytotoxic activity on the cancer cell lines A2780 (ovarian), ACHN (renal), MCF-7 (breast), H69 (SCLC) and U-937 (lymphoma). Parallel aliquots of the cells were grown at different oxygen pressures and after 72 hours of drug exposure viability was measured with the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA). RESULTS: Sorafenib, irinotecan and docetaxel were in general more effective in an oxygenated environment, while cisplatin, mitomycin c and tirapazamine were more effective in a low oxygen environment. Surprisingly, hypoxia in H69 and MCF-7 cells mostly rendered higher drug sensitivity. In contrast ACHN appeared more sensitive to hypoxia, giving slower proliferating cells, and consequently, was more resistant to most drugs. CONCLUSIONS: A panel of standard cytotoxic agents was tested against five different human cancer cell lines cultivated at normoxic, hypoxic and anoxic conditions. Results show that impaired chemosensitivity is not universal, in contrast different cell lines behave different and some drugs appear even less effective in normoxia than hypoxia."

The in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the cells were sensitive to paclitaxel and doxorubicin, but resistant to cisplatin.

The p38?? pathway regulates inflammatory responses but can also suppress tumor initiation in epithelial cells. We have found that p38?? signaling has a dual function in colorectal tumorigenesis. On one side, p38?? protects intestinal epithelial cells against colitis-associated colon cancer by regulating intestinal epithelial barrier function. Accordingly, p38?? downregulation results in enhanced colitis-induced epithelial damage and inflammation, which potentiates colon tumor formation. Surprisingly, inhibition of p38?? in transformed colon epithelial cells reduces tumor burden. Thus, p38?? suppresses inflammation-associated epithelial damage and tumorigenesis but contributes to the proliferation and survival of tumor cells. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among women. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is an FDA-approved drug for bipolar disorder. Breast cancer is reported to occur with higher rate in women with bipolar disorder. The effect of LiCl on the response of breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation has not been studied. We studied the effect of LiCl on the radiosensitivity of radioresistant T47D breast cancer cell line. Treatment of T47D cells with 20 mM LiCl for 24 hours decreased the radioresistance of these cells indicated by clonogenic survival assay. Comet assay demonstrated decreased DNA repair in LiCl-treated cells. LiCl treatment also decreased the meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11) mRNA level. Mre11 is an essential protein for DNA repair whose transcription is regulated by \u03b2-catenin protein. Western blot analysis indicated that the \u03b2-catenin protein level was decreased in LiCl-treated cells. LiCl increased glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) protein that is involved in \u03b2-catenin degradation. The results demonstrated that LiCl could radiosensitize T47D cells by decreasing DNA repair, partially through Mre11 repression. GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin/Mre11 pathway might be the connection between LiCl treatment and the decreased DNA repair in T47D cells."

        "abstract": "N-??-acetyltransferase 10 protein, Naa10p, is an N-acetyltransferase known to be involved in cell cycle control. We found that Naa10p was expressed lower in varieties of malignancies with lymph node metastasis compared with non-lymph node metastasis. Higher Naa10p expression correlates the survival of lung cancer patients. Naa10p significantly suppressed migration, tumor growth, and metastasis independent of its enzymatic activity. Instead, Naa10p binds to the GIT-binding domain of PIX, thereby preventing the formation of the GIT-PIX-Paxillin complex, resulting in reduced intrinsic Cdc42/Rac1 activity and decreased cell migration. Forced expression of PIX in Naa10-transfected tumor cells restored the migration and metastasis ability. We suggest that Naa10p functions as a tumor metastasis suppressor by disrupting the migratory complex, PIX-GIT- Paxillin, in cancer cells. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Bi-allelic inactivation of tumor suppressors may occur through genetic mechanisms (such as loss of function mutation, copy number (CN) loss, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH)), epigenetic mechanisms (such as promoter methylation or histone modification), or a combination of the two. We report systematically derived status of 69 known or putative tumor suppressors, across 799 samples of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. In order to generate such resource we constructed a novel comprehensive computational framework for the assessment of tumor suppressor functional \"status\". This approach utilizes several orthogonal genomic data types, including mutation data, copy number, LOH and expression. Through correlation with additional data types (compound sensitivity and gene set activity) we show that this integrative method provides a more accurate assessment of tumor suppressor status than can be inferred by expression, copy number, or mutation alone. This approach has the potential for a more realistic assessment of tumor suppressor genes for both basic and translational oncology research. \u00a9 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies."

However, information on protein-changing mutations, genetic heterogeneity and genetic (in)stability is largely lacking for these cells. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing of the LNCaP exome revealed many single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To help identify the mutations that are most likely drivers of the oncogenic process, we developed an in silico protocol, which can be adapted for other exome analyses. RESULTS: We detected 1,802 non-synonymous SNVs and 218 small insertions and deletions in the LNCaP exome. We confirm the known mutations in the androgen receptor and the PTEN gene, but most other mutations remained undescribed until now. The presence of 38 out of 42 SNVs was confirmed in monoclonal as well as in polyclonal LNCaP derivatives. Moreover, most variants were also detectable in LNCaP mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an extensive database of genetic variations in the protein-coding part of the genome of LNCaP cells, which should be taken into consideration when using LNCaP cells or its derivatives as models for prostate cancer. From the analysis of several LNCaP-derived cultures and clones, we can confirm that the cell line is heterozygous for a large number of variants and that both the variant and the wild-type allele can be simultaneously expressed as mRNA. The fact that the SNVs in the E-cadherin, CDK4, Notch1, and PlexinB1 genes are absent in some of the subclones strongly indicates a degree of genetic instability.

Several reports suggested that the MDA-MB-435 cell line, a cell line extensively used for studying breast cancer biology, has a gene expression pattern most compatible with melanocyte origin. However, we demonstrate that MDA-MB-435 cells express breast-specific or epithelial-specific markers. Also, MDA-MB-435 cells were induced to express breast differentiation-specific proteins and secrete milk lipids as observed in other well-established breast cancer cell lines. Notably, MDA-MB-435 cells also expressed melanocyte-specific proteins as did another highly aggressive breast cancer cell line. MDA-MB-435 xenograft tissue sections stained entirely positive for epithelium-specific markers but only partially positive for melanocyte-specific markers. Thus, MDA-MB-435 is most likely a breast epithelial cell line that has undergone lineage infidelity."

HCC cell lines established from different patients would be useful in elucidating the molecular pathogenesis. However, success of HCC primary culture establishment remains at low rate. We aim to establish and characterize HCC primary culture and the derived cell line.\\n\\nMETHODS: Fresh tumor tissues were collected from 30 HCC patients. Culture conditions were optimized for the attachment and growth of the isolated hepatocytes. Granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP), a growth factor reported to associate with cancer stem cell properties, was examined by flow cytometry to elucidate its role on primary culture establishment. The primary cell line was characterized in detail.\\n\\nRESULTS: Cells isolated from 16 out of 30 HCC cases (53%) had viability more than 70% and were subject to subsequent in vitro culture. 7 out of 16 cases (44%) could give rise to cells that were able to attach and grow in culture. GEP expression levels significantly correlated with the viability of isolated hepatocytes and success rate of subsequent primary culture establishment. Cells from HCC patient 21 grew and expanded rapidly in vitro and was selected to be further characterized. The line, designated HCC21, derived from a Hong Kong Chinese female patient with HCC at Stage II. The cells exhibited typical epithelial morphology and expressed albumin, AFP and HBV antigens. The cell line was authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis. Comparative genome hybridization analysis revealed chromosomal loss at 1p35-p36, 1q44, 2q11.2-q24.3, 2q37, 4q12-q13.3, 4q21.21-q35.2, 8p12-p23, 15q11.2-q14, 15q24-q26, 16p12.1-p13.3, 16q, 17p, 22q and gain at 1q21-q43 in both HCC21 cells and the original clinical tumor specimen. Sequence analysis revealed p53 gene mutation. Subcutaneous injection of HCC21 cells into immunodeficient mice showed that the cells were able to form tumors at the primary injection sites and metastatic tumors in the peritoneal cavity.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The newly established cell line could serve as useful in vitro and in vivo models for studying primary HCC that possess metastasis ability."

Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER-2/neu) gene and its protein are associated with increased cell division and a high rate of tumor growth and have been reported in several malignancies. Especially, approximately 30% of breast cancer patients have overexpression of HER-2/neu protein and the overexpression metastasize faster, induces resistance of the chemotherapy and down-regulate function of estrogen receptor. Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 antibody (Herceptin) inhibits proliferation of HER-2/neu overexpressing tumor cells and the use of that in combination in metastatic breast cancer have increased cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents.\\n\\nMETHODS: We evaluated the expression of HER-2/neu protein in gastric cell lines by FACS and then comparing the cytotoxicity in chemotherapeutics (doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, 5-FU) alone and in combination with Herceptin according to the expression of HER-2/neu protein by MTT assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: 1. NCI-N87 (88%) gastric cancer cell line and SK-BR-3 (89%) breast cancer cell line with strong positivity of HER-2/neu expression. YBC-2 (55%) and YBC-3 (48%) gastric cancer cell line with intermediated, weak positivity respectively. Negative control U-87 MG (6%) brain cancer cell line were showed low expression of HER-2/neu. 2. Cell growth was dose-dependently inhibited in HER-2/neu positive, control cell line SK-BR-3 by Herceptin treatment but not observed in HER-2/neu negative control cell line U-87 MG. Effective growth inhibition was not observed in gastric cancer cell lines with single treatment of Herceptin, all cell lines observed the dose-dependent growth inhibition to chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel and 5-FU). 3. Combination of Herceptin with doxorubicin observed synergistic effects in all cancer cell lines except YBC-3, combination of Herceptin with cisplatin observed NCI-N87 and SK-BR-3 and combination of Herceptin with paclitaxel observed synergistic effects in YBC-2. Combination of Herceptin with 5-FU observed antagonistic effects in all cancer cell lines.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: According to HER-2/neu expression level, effect of anti-cancer agents was observed differently in combination of Herceptin with chemotherapeutic agents. This suggests that HER-2/neu expression level can be applied standard of combination drug selection in combination of Herceptin With chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer."

The ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis and exhibit limitless replication potential allows for progression of cancer from a benign to a metastatic phenotype. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the effect of the isoflavone phenoxodiol on the expression of cell cycle genes.\\n\\nMETHODS: Three prostate cancer cell lines-LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 were cultured in vitro, and then treated with phenoxodiol (10\u00a0\u03bcM and 30\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24 and 48\u00a0h. The expression of cell cycle genes p21(WAF1), c-Myc, Cyclin-D1, and Ki-67 was investigated by Real Time PCR.\\n\\nRESULTS: Here we report that phenoxodiol induces cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, with the resultant arrest due to the upregulation of p21(WAF1) in all the cell lines in response to treatment, indicating that activation of p21(WAF1) and subsequent cell arrest was occurring via a p53 independent manner, with induction of cytotoxicity independent of caspase activation. We found that c-Myc and Cyclin-D1 expression was not consistently altered across all cell lines but Ki-67 signalling expression was decreased in line with the cell cycle arrest.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Phenoxodiol demonstrates an ability in prostate cancer cells to induce significant cytotoxicity in cells by interacting with p21(WAF1) and inducing cell cycle arrest irrespective of p53 status or caspase pathway interactions. These data indicate that phenoxodiol would be effective as a potential future treatment modality for both hormone sensitive and hormone refractory prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (ASPP) family comprises three members, namely, ASPP1, ASPP2, and iASPP. They regulate the promotive effect of p53 on apoptosis. Breast cancer (BC) remains as one of the leading causes of cancer or cancer-related mortality among women. However, the relationship between the ASPP family members and p53, as well as the dissemination and expression pattern of ASPP family members in p53+ BC, has not been elucidated. Our objectives are to detect the expression of ASPP family members in p53+ BC cell lines and determine its significance in tumor cell apoptosis.\\n\\nMETHODS: The mRNA expression of ASPP family members in five p53+ BC cell lines was detected through RT-PCR and assayed using Quality-one software. The p53 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Afterward, the apoptosis indices of the five BC cell lines were detected by flow cytometry.\\n\\nRESULTS: The iASPP mRNA was expressed in Bcap-37, MCF-7, and HBL-100. Compared with the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, significant differences were found in the ASPP1 mRNA in Bcap-37, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HBL-100 (p <\u20090.05), except that in ZR-75-30 (p >\u20090.05). The ASPP2 mRNA was expressed in MDA-MB-231, Bcap-37, and MCF-7, but not in HBL-100 and ZR-75-30. The p53 protein was expressed in five breast cancer cell lines. ZR-75-30 and MDA-MB-231 apoptosis indices were higher than those of other breast cancer cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p <\u20090.01).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The mRNA expression of ASPP family members varied in the five p53+ BC cell lines. The results also verified that the family members have an important function in apoptosis, which was promoted by p53 protein. ZR-75-30 BC showed high apoptosis index, without expression of any ASPP family members, indicating that the pathway of apoptosis in this cell line may be related to other cell transduction pathway. MDA-MB-231, Bcap37, and MCF-7 cell lines all expressed ASPP1/2. However, the apoptosis pathway in MDA-MB-231 is different from those of the other two cell lines. The status of the different cell lines should also be considered when the functions of the ASPP family members are examined."

        "abstract": "The cancer stem cell (CSC) model, in which a small population of cells within a tumor possesses the ability to self-renew and reconstitute the phenotype of primary tumor, has gained wide acceptance based on evidence over the past decade. It has also been reported that cancer cell lines contain a CSC subpopulation. However, phenotypic differences between CSCs and non-CSCs in cancer cell lines are not better defined than in primary tumors. Furthermore, some cell lines do not have a CSC population, revealed as a side population and expression of CD133. Thus, the identification of CSCs in cancer cell lines remains elusive. Here, we investigated the CSC hierarchy within HCT116 colon cancer cells, which do not have a CD133-positive subpopulation. We examined the expression of alternative CSC markers epithelial specific antigen (ESA) and CD44 in floating-sphere-derived cells, which are known to be the cells of enriching CSCs. Sphere-derived HCT116 cells exhibited heterogeneous expression of ESA and CD44. The two major subpopulations of HCT116 sphere cells (ESA(low)CD44(-/low) and ESA(high)CD44(high)) exhibited a biological/proliferative hierarchy of sphere-forming and soft agar colony-forming activity. However, there was no difference between the two subpopulations in the incidence of xenograft tumors. When ESA(low)CD44(-/low) cells were allowed to aggregate and re-form floating-spheres, the biological/proliferative hierarchy of parental HCT116 spheres was reconstituted, in terms of ESA and CD44 expression. Thus, HCT116 cells have plasticity when they are set in floating-spheres, suggesting that maintenance of the HCT116 cell line conforms to a stochastic model, not a CSC model."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancers are the most common type of human malignancy and are intractable. Lung cancers are generally classified into four histopathological subtypes: adenocarcinoma (AD), squamous cell carcinoma (SQ), large cell carcinoma (LC), and small cell carcinoma (SC). Molecular biological characterization of these subtypes has been performed mainly using DNA microarrays. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of these four subtypes using twelve human lung cancer cell lines and the more reliable quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: We selected 100 genes from public DNA microarray data and examined them by DNA microarray analysis in eight test cell lines (A549, ABC-1, EBC-1, LK-2, LU65, LU99, STC 1, RERF-LC-MA) and a normal control lung cell line (MRC-9). From this, we extracted 19 candidate genes. We quantified the expression of the 19 genes and a housekeeping gene, GAPDH, with qPCR, using the same eight cell lines plus four additional validation lung cancer cell lines (RERF-LC-MS, LC-1/sq, 86-2, and MS-1-L). Finally, we characterized the four subtypes of lung cancer cell lines using principal component analysis (PCA) of gene expression profiling for 12 of the 19 genes (AMY2A, CDH1, FOXG1, IGSF3, ISL1, MALL, PLAU, RAB25, S100P, SLCO4A1, STMN1, and TGM2). The combined PCA and gene pathway analyses suggested that these genes were related to cell adhesion, growth, and invasion. S100P in AD cells and CDH1 in AD and SQ cells were identified as candidate markers of these lung cancer subtypes based on their upregulation and the results of PCA analysis. Immunohistochemistry for S100P and RAB25 was closely correlated to gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the four subtypes, represented by 12 lung cancer cell lines, were well characterized using qPCR and PCA for the 12 genes examined. Certain genes, in particular S100P and CDH1, may be especially important for distinguishing the different subtypes. Our results confirm that qPCR and PCA analysis provide a useful tool for characterizing cancer cell subtypes, and we discuss the possible clinical applications of this approach."

        "abstract": "Two novel triple negative breast cancer cell lines, NIPBC-1 and NIPBC-2 were successfully established from primary tumors of two young breast cancer patients aged 39 and 38\u00a0years respectively, diagnosed as infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast. Characterization of these cell lines showed luminal origin with expression of epithelial specific antigen and cytokeratin 18 and presence of microfilaments and secretary vesicles, microvilli, tight junctions and desmosomes on ultra-structural analysis. Both the cell lines showed anchorage independent growth and invasion of matrigel coated membranes. Karyotype analysis showed aneuploidy, deletions and multiple rearrangements in chromosomes 7, 9, X and 11 and isochromosomes 17q in both the cell lines. P53 mutational analysis revealed no mutation in the coding region in both the cell lines; however NIPBC-2 cell line showed presence of heterozygous C/G polymorphism, g.417 C\u2009>\u2009G (NM_000546.5) resulting in Arg/Pro allele at codon 72 of exon 4. Screening for mutations in BRCA1&2 genes revealed presence of three heterozygous polymorphisms in exon 11 of BRCA1 and 2 polymorphisms in exons 11, and14 of BRCA2 gene in both the cell lines. Both the cell lines showed presence of CD 44+/24-breast cancer stem cells and capability of producing mammosphere on culture. The two triple negative breast cancer cell lines established from early onset breast tumors can serve as novel invitro models to study mechanisms underlying breast tumorigenesis in younger age group patients and also identification of new therapeutic modalities targeting cancer stem cells."

However, tumour cell lines growing as multicellular tumour spheroids (MTS) frequently develop multicellular resistance in a drug-independent form. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotypic and functional differences between two human NSCLC cell lines (INER-37 and INER-51) grown as traditional monolayer cultures versus as MTS.\\n\\nMETHODS: After 72\u00a0hours treatment with anticancer drugs, chemosensitivity in monolayers and tumour spheroids cultures was assessed using MTT assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect the mRNAs of multidrug resistance-related genes. The expression of P-gp was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and cell cycle profiles were analyzed using FACS.\\n\\nRESULTS: The results indicate that when grown as MTS each lung cancer cell line had different morphologies as well as and abrogation of cell proliferation with decrease of the G2/M phase. Also, MTS acquired multicellular resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents in only a few days of culture which were accomplished by significant changes in the expression of MDR-related genes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Overall, the MTS culture changed the cellular response to drugs nevertheless each of the cell lines studied seems to implement different mechanisms to acquire multicellular resistance."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of male cancer specific mortality. When cure by radical prostatectomy is not possible the next line of prostate cancer treatment is androgen deprivation. However prolonged androgen deprivation often results in relapse and androgen-independent prostate cancer that is inevitably fatal despite optimal chemotherapy. The Hedgehog signalling pathway has recently been implicated in prostate cancer development and metastasis. EGFR or ErbB2 expression has been also correlated with androgen independence, shorter survival and metastasis.\\n\\nRESULTS: We determined that the Hedgehog and ErbB signalling pathways are active in circulating tumour cells isolated from androgen-independent prostate cancer patients and in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP C4-2B. As a basis for synergistic chemotherapy protocols combinations of the Hedgehog specific inhibitor cyclopamine and the ErbB signalling inhibitors gefitinib or lapatinib were tested in this study. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth was inhibited by a SMO inhibitor (cyclopamine) which blocks Hedgehog signalling and by ErbB inhibitors (gefitinib and lapatinib). The isobologram and combination index method of Chou and Talalay was used to evaluate drug interactions. Synergistic antiproliferation effects were observed when the Hedgehog and ErbB inhibitors were combined.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation was associated with activity of the Hedgehog and ErbB signalling pathways. Cyclopamine, gefitinib or lapatinib treatment significantly decreased the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The Hedgehog pathway therefore represents a promising new therapeutic target in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Synergistic effects were observed when Hedgehog and ErbB inhibitors were used together. This study may have clinical implications for improving the treatment of advanced prostate cancer."

The present in vitro study investigates the mechanism of action of Zoledronic Acid on breast cancer cell lines with different hormonal and HER2 patterns. Furthermore, we investigated the efficacy of repeated versus non-repeated treatments.\\n\\nMETHODS: The study was performed on 4 breast cancer cell lines (BRC-230, SkBr3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Non-repeated treatment (single exposure of 168\u2009hrs' duration) with zoledronic acid was compared with repeated treatment (separate exposures, each of 48\u2009hrs' duration, for a total of 168\u2009hrs) at different dosages. A dose-response profile was generated using sulforhodamine B assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay and biomolecular characteristics were analyzed by western blot.\\n\\nRESULTS: Zoledronic acid produced a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation in all cell lines. Anti-proliferative activity was enhanced with the repeated treatment, proving to be statistically significant in the triple-negative lines. In these lines repeated treatment showed a cytocidal effect, with apoptotic cell death caused by caspase 3, 8 and 9 activation and decreased RAS and pMAPK expression. Apoptosis was not observed in estrogen receptor-positive line: p21 overexpression suggested a slowing down of cell cycle. A decrease in RAS and pMAPK expression was seen in HER2-overexpressing line after treatment.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that zoledronic acid has an antitumor activity in breast cancer cell lines. Its mechanism of action involves the decrease of RAS and RHO, as in osteoclasts. Repeated treatment enhances antitumor activity compared to non-repeated treatment. Repeated treatment has a killing effect on triple-negative lines due to apoptosis activation. Further research is warranted especially in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer."

While evidence about anticancer effects exists, the mechanism explaining this effect is still unknown. Methods We investigated in vitro, and with computer simulation, the influence of a 50 Hz EMF on three cancer cell lines: breast cancer MDA-MB-231, and colon cancer SW-480 and HCT- 116. After 24 h preincubation, cells were exposed to 50 Hz extremely low frequency (ELF) radiofrequency EMF using in vitro exposure systems for 24 and 72 h. A computer reactiondiffusion model with the net rate of cell proliferation and effect of EMF in time was developed. The fitting procedure for estimation of the computer model parameters was implemented. Results Experimental results clearly showed disintegration of cells treated with a 50 Hz EMF, compared to untreated control cells. A large percentage of treated cells resulted in increased early apoptosis after 24 h and 72 h, compared to the controls. Computer model have shown good comparison with experimental data. Conclusion Using EMF at specific frequencies may represent a new approach in controlling the growth of cancer cells, while computer modelling could be used to predict such effects and make optimisation for complex experimental design. Further studies are required before testing this approach in humans.

Here, we determined if SP cells exist in a verified cell line originating from recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and a xenograft established from recurrent metastatic NPC. These cells were evaluated for stem-like properties via functional assays as well as for tumourigenicity.\\n\\nMETHODS: We used Hoechst 33342 to identify the SP from non-SP (NSP) cells in HK1 NPC cell line and xeno-284 NPC xenograft. The cells were assayed for in vitro characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSC), gene expression and tumourigenicity ability. Student's t test was used to test for significance.\\n\\nRESULTS: Five to ten percent and less than 0.5% of HK1 and xeno-284 NPC cells, respectively, were SP cells. Fumitremorgin C (FTC), as opposed to verapamil, was effective in causing the cells to retain Hoechst 33342 dye. HK1 SP cells formed more holoclones, had more aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, divided asymmetrically and contained slow-proliferating cells. ABCG2, SOX2, TERT, MYC, Hedgehog, Notch, TGF\u03b2 and Wnt signalling pathway genes were significantly upregulated in the SP cells. However, despite these differences in vitro, both HK1 SP and NSP cells had an overall similar tumourigenic potential in vivo.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: HK1 SP cells were ABCG2-specific as confirmed by FTC inhibition and gene expression data. Despite data from in vitro and gene expression experiments suggesting stem-like features, there was no significant difference in tumourigenic potential between SP and NSP cells. We conclude that SP assay alone is not sufficient to identify CSCs in HK1 cells. Our work also suggests the presence of a stem-cell like population among NPC cells which do not display increased tumourigenicity."

Since, multicellular spheroids studies have evidenced alterations in numerous cellular components, including those related to the plasma membrane function, result plausible that some of these changes might modulate P-gp function and be responsible for the acquisition of multicellular drug resistance. In the present study, we asked if a human lung cancer cell line (INER-51) grown as multicellular spheroids can modify the P-gp activity to decrease the levels of doxorubicin (DXR) retained and increase their drug resistance. RESULTS: Our results showed that INER-51 spheroids retain 3-folds lower doxorubicin than the same cells as monolayers however; differences in retention were not observed when the P-gp substrate Rho-123 was used. Interestingly, neither the use of the P-gp-modulating agent cyclosporin-A (Cs-A) nor a decrease in ATP-pools were able to increase DXR retention in the multicellular spheroids. Only the lack of P-gp expression throughout the pharmacological selection of a P-gp negative (P-gpneg) mutant clone (PSC-1) derived from INER-51 cells, allow increase of DXR retention in spheroids. CONCLUSION: Thus, multicellular arrangement appears to alter the P-gp activity to maintain lower levels of DXR. However, the non expression of P-gp by cells forming multicellular spheroids has only a minor impact in the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents."

However, the signaling that regulates expression of PBK in cancer cells remains elusive. Here we show that atorvastatin (Lipitor), an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase that is a rate-limiting enzyme of mevalonate pathway, down-regulates expression of PBK by impairing protein geranylgeranylation. The shRNA knockdown demonstrated that Yes-associated protein (YAP) mediates geranylgeranylation-regulated expression of PBK. Importantly, atorvastatin or the geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation through inactivation of YAP signaling and down-regulation of PBK. These findings have defined a new signaling pathway that regulated expression of PBK and identified PBK as a downstream target of the Hippo-YAP signaling, uncoverd a mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effect by inhibition of mevalonate pathway and geranylgeranylation, and provided a potential target for breast cancer targeted therapy."

Here, we performed a systematical analysis of the phosphoproteome of A549 by using mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategies. This investigation led to the identification of 337 phosphorylation sites on 181 phosphoproteins. Among them, 67 phosphoproteins and 230 phosphorylation sites identified appeared to be novel with no previous characterization in lung cancer. Based on their known functions as reported in the literature, these phosphoproteins were functionally organized into highly interconnected networks. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to validate the expression of a bottleneck phosphoprotein YAP1 in cancer cell lines and tissues. This dataset provides a valuable resource for further studies on phosphorylation and lung carcinogenesis."

An exquisite balance of inhibitory and activating receptors tightly controls the NK cell activity. At present, one of the best-characterized activating receptors is NKG2D, which promotes the NK-mediated lysis of target cells by binding to a family of cell surface ligands encoded by the MHC class I chain-related (MIC) genes, among others. The goal of this study was to describe the expression pattern of MICA and MICB at the molecular and cellular levels in human cervical cancer cell lines infected or not with human papillomavirus, as well as in a non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line. RESULTS: Here we show that MICA and MICB exhibit differential expression patterns among HPV-infected (SiHa and HeLa) and non-infected cell lines (C33-A, a tumor cell line, and HaCaT, an immortalized keratinocyte cell line). Cell surface expression of MICA was higher than cell surface expression of MICB in the HPV-positive cell lines; in contrast, HPV-negative cells expressed lower levels of MICA. Interestingly, the MICA levels observed in C33-A cells were overcome by significantly higher MICB expression. Also, all cell lines released higher amounts of soluble MICB than of soluble MICA into the cell culture supernatant, although this was most pronounced in C33-A cells. Additionally, Real-Time PCR analysis demonstrated that MICA was strongly upregulated after genotoxic stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that even when MICA and MICB share a high degree of homology at both genomic and protein levels, differential regulation of their expression and cell surface appearance might be occurring in cervical cancer-derived cells."

This cell line has been in continuous culture for more than one year and has been named as Mehr-80. Several features of the cell line were investigated, including growth characteristics, electron microscopic features, cloning efficiency in soft agar, expression of various antigenic markers, chromosomal and DNA analysis. On the basis of morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of Mehr-80, it is possible to conclude that this cell line is characterized by features similar to those reported for large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (LCCND).

We study the inhibitory effect of ATO at various concentrations on the proliferation of the myeloma cell line RPMI 8226 and discussed the molecular mechanism of ATO on myeloma cell line. Our results proved that ATO had a significant dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the expressions of the Notch receptor (Notch1) and Notch ligand (Jag2). Data from the real-time PCR assay showed that the mRNA expression levels of the Jag2 gene and its downstream gene Hes1 were both significantly down-regulated after the myeloma cells were treated with ATO while the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was up-regulated. These results elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the ATO mediated inhibition of myeloma cell proliferation.

The IC50 values for paclitaxel in J82/WT and J82/MMC-2 cell lines were 0.7 ?? 0.03 and 2.8 ?? 0.7 ??M, respectively (P < 0.05). Thus, the J82/MMC-2 cell line exhibited 4-fold cross-resistance to paclitaxel compared with J82/WT. Intracellular accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel was comparable in J82/WT and J82/MMC-2 cell lines. There were no qualitative or quantitative differences between the J82/WT and J82/MMC-2 cell lines in terms of their ??- tubulin and ??-tubulin contents. Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis could not be detected in either cell line over a wide range of drug concentrations. These results indicate that cross-resistance to paclitaxel in the J82/MMC-2 cell line is not linked to reduced drug accumulation, increased drug efflux, alterations in tubulin content or reduced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Paclitaxel-induced DNA strand breakage, however, determined by alkaline elution, was markedly lower in the J82/MMC-2 cell line than in J82/WT. These results suggest that paclitaxel cross-resistance in J82/MMC-2 may be attributed to reduced paclitaxel-induced DNA strand breakage. The precise mechanism of reduced paclitaxel-induced DNA strand breakage in J82/MMC-2 cell line relative to J82/WT cells, however, remains to be elucidated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd."

The aim of this work is to explore the effects of zoledronic acid on cell proliferation and invasion in lung cancer cell line 95D. METHODS: The effect of zoledrnic acid (ZOL) on proliferation of lung cancer cell line 95D was detected by MTT. The expression of proliferation and invasion-relation genes and proteins were detected by Western blot, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Changes of invasion of lung cancer cell numbers were measured by polycarbonates coated with Matrigel. RESULTS: ZOL could inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cell line 95D in vitro in a time-dependant and a dose-dependant manner. With time extending after ZOL treated, the mRNA expresion of VEGF, MMP9, MMP2 and protein expression of VEGF, MMP9, ERK1/ERK2 were decreased. The results of Tanswell invasion showed the numbers of invasive cells were significantly reduced in 95D cells treated with ZOL 4 d and 6 d later. CONCLUSIONS: ZOL could inhibit cell proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cell line 95D."

        "abstract": "Radiotherapy is an effective approach to treating many types of cancer. Recent progress in radiotherapy technology, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy, allow precise energy transfer to the tumor, which has improved local control rates. However, the emergence of tolerant cells during or after radiotherapy remains problematic. In the present study, we first established a cell population from H1299, the p53-null non-small cell lung cancer cell line, by 10 Gy irradiation using 6 MV X-rays. The radio- and chemosensitivity of this cell population (referred to as H1299-IR) was determined using colony formation analyses and MTS assays. Compared with the parental cell line, the radiosensitivity of H1299-IR was apparently the same. H1299 and H1299-IR were both more radio tolerant than the A549 cell line. However, H1299-IR became significantly more sensitive to cisplatin, an antitumor agent. After exposure to 25 mug/ml cisplatin for 2 h, parental cells steadily grew during the MTS assay, whereas the sensitivity of H1299-IR cells doubled both at 24 and 48 h. Microarray analysis of over 30,000 H1299-IR genes (Agilent Technology) revealed that 12 and 15 genes were up- (> 2.0) and down- (< 2.0) regulated, respectively. Rad51d (homologous recombination repair protein) gene was down-regulated 2.8-fold, whereas matrix metalloproteinase 1 (collagenase-1) gene was up-regulated 4.4-fold. These results indicated that some p53-null non-small cell lung cancers could be successfully treated when X-ray radiotherapy was administered with subsequent or concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy."

As an example, the resistance of cancer mitochondria against apoptosis-associated permeabilization and the altered contribution of these organelles to metabolism are closely related. Similarly, the constitutive activation of signaling cascades that stimulate cell growth has a profound impact on anabolic metabolism. Here, we review the peculiarities of tumor cell metabolism that might be taken advantage of for cancer treatment. Specifically, we discuss the alterations in signal transduction pathways and/or enzymatic machineries that account for metabolic reprogramming of transformed cells."

These genes act cooperatively to cause osteolytic metastasis, and most of them encode secreted and cell surface proteins. Two of these genes, interleukin-11 and CTGF, encode osteolytic and angiogenic factors whose expression is further increased by the prometastatic cytokine TGF??. Overexpression of this bone metastasis gene set is superimposed on a poor-prognosis gene expression signature already present in the parental breast cancer population, suggesting that metastasis requires a set of functions beyond those underlying the emergence of the primary tumor."

Currently, this compendium holds genome wide expression profiles of 317 different cancer cell lines, categorized into 57 different pathological states and 28 individual tissues. To enlarge the scope of CellLineNavigator, the database was furthermore closely linked to commonly used bioinformatics databases and knowledge repositories. To ensure easy data access and search ability, a simple data and an intuitive querying interface were implemented. It allows the user to explore and filter gene expression, focusing on pathological or physiological conditions. For a more complex search, the advanced query interface may be used to query for (i) differentially expressed genes; (ii) pathological or physiological conditions; or (iii) gene names or functional attributes, such as Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. These queries may also be combined. Finally, CellLineNavigator allows additional advanced analysis of differentially regulated genes by a direct link to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources."

The aims of this study were to determine whether curcumin could induce the apoptosis of a gallbladder carcinoma cell line, GBC-SD, and to clarify its related mechanism.\\n\\nMETHODS: First, the anti-proliferative activities of curcumin-treated and untreated GBC-SD cells were determined using the MTT and colony formation assays. Then, the early apoptosis of cells was detected by the annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining assay and Hoechst 33342 staining assay. Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential was used to validate the ability of curcumin on inducing apoptosis in GBC-SD cells. Cell cycle changes were detected by flow cytometric analysis. Finally, the expressions of the apoptosis-related proteins or genes caspase-3, PARP, Bcl-2, and Bax were analyzed by western blot and quantitative real time PCR assay. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t-test for comparison of the results obtained from cells with or without curcumin treatment.\\n\\nRESULTS: The MTT assay revealed that curcumin had induced a dose- and a time-dependent decrease in cell viability. Colony counting indicated that curcumin had induced a dose-dependent decrease in the colony formation ability in GBC-SD cells. Cells treated with curcumin were arrested at the S phase, according to the flow cytometric analysis. A significant induction of both the early and late phases of apoptosis was shown by the annexin V-FITC and PI staining. Morphological changes in apoptotic cells were also found by the Hoechst 33342 staining. After treatment with curcumin fluorescence shifted from red to green as \u0394\u03a8m decreased. Furthermore, western blot and quantitative real time PCR assays demonstrated that the curcumin induced apoptosis in GBC-SD cells by regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and activating the expression of cleaved caspase-3.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results indicate that curcumin may be a potential agent for the treatment of gallbladder cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MiR-133b is a muscle-specific microRNA; it has a role in the formation of cardiocytes and the expression of myocardium ion channels by regulating target genes. Many human malignant tumors demonstrate a low expression of miR-133b, as noted in colorectal, lung, esophagus and bladder cancers, but the role of miR-133b in bladder cancer is unknown. METHODS: The expression of miR-133b in clinical bladder cancer specimens and adjacent normal tissues was confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. We also analyzed the relationship between miR-133b expression and clinicopathological factors of bladder cancer. Bcl-w and Akt1 protein expression in 41 bladder cancer specimens and adjacent normal tissues was detected by Western blot. After transfection of miR-133b mimics or inhibitor into a T24 human bladder cancer cell line, Bcl-w and Akt1 protein and mRNA expression were examined by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. The effect of miR-133b on T24 cell proliferation and apoptosis was measured by CCK-8 tests and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: The expression of miR-133b in bladder cancer tissues from 41 patients was significantly down-regulated (P < 0.01); low expression of miR-133b was strongly associated with high-grade bladder cancer (P < 0.01). Bcl-w and Akt1 proteins were significantly overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues versus adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.01 for both). The expression of Akt1 and Bcl-w proteins and Akt1 mRNA, in T24 cells was significantly down-regulated or up-regulated after transfection of miR-133b mimics or inhibitor, respectively; however, there was no significant difference in Bcl-w mRNA expression. Transfection of HEK-293 T cells with miR-133b significantly suppressed a luciferase-reporter containing the Bcl-w or Akt 1 3'-untranslated regions. MiR-133b mimics significantly inhibited T24 cell proliferation, as well as increased T24 cell apoptosis (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) while the miR-133b inhibitor increased and decreased these, respectively (P < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-133b may play a very important role in the proliferation and apoptosis of T24 cells by regulating the expression of Bcl-w and Akt1."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piper sarmentosum, locally known as kaduk is belonging to the family of Piperaceae. It is our interest to evaluate their effect on human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) for the potential of anticarcinogenic activity. RESULTS: The anticarcinogenic activity of an ethanolic extract from Piper sarmentosum in HepG2 and non-malignant Chang's liver cell lines has been previously determined using (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assays, where the IC50 value was used as a parameter for cytotoxicity. The ethanolic extract that showed anticarcinogenic properties in HepG2 cells had an IC50 of 12.5 mug mL-1, while IC50 values in the non-malignant Chang's liver cell line were greater than 30 mug mL-1. Apoptotic morphological changes in HepG2 cells were observed using an inverted microscope and showed chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and apoptotic bodies following May-Grunwald-Giemsa's staining. The percentage of apoptotic cells in the overall population (apoptotic index) showed a continuously significant increase (p < 0.05) in 12.5 mug mL-1 ethanolic extract-treated cells at 24, 48 and 72 hours compared to controls (untreated cells). Following acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining, treatment with 10, 12 and 14 mug mL-1 of ethanolic extracts caused typical apoptotic morphological changes in HepG2 cells. Molecular analysis of DNA fragmentation was used to examine intrinsic apoptosis induced by the ethanolic extracts. These results showed a typical intrinsic apoptotic characterisation, which included fragmentation of nuclear DNA in ethanolic extract-treated HepG2 cells. However, the non-malignant Chang's liver cell line produced no DNA fragmentation. In addition, the DNA genome was similarly intact for both the untreated non-malignant Chang's liver and HepG2 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Therefore, our results suggest that the ethanolic extract from P. sarmentosum induced anticarcinogenic activity through an intrinsic apoptosis pathway in HepG2 cells in vitro."

        "abstract": "Background : One of the major cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatases is protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1). Studies employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial role for PP1 activity in controlling cell cycle progression. One physiological substrate for PP1 appears to be the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (pRB), a demonstrated tumor suppressor. The growth suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its phosphorylation state. Of critical importance is the question of the in vivo effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation. As a first step towards addressing this question, we developed an inducible PP1 expression system to investigate the regulation of PP1 activity. Results : We have established a cell line for inducing protein expression of the type 1, alpha-isotype, serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1\u03b1). A plasmid encoding a fusion protein of the catalytic subunit of PP1\u03b1 with a 6-histidine peptide (6His) and a peptide from hemagluttinin (HA) was transfected into the UMUC3 transitional cell carcinoma cell line, previously transfected with the reverse tetracycline transactivator plasmid pUHD172-1neo. A stable cell line designated LLWO2F was established by selection with hygromycin B. 6His-HA-PP1\u03b1 protein appeared in cell lysates within two hours following addition of doxycycline to the culture medium. This protein localizes to the nucleus as does endogenous PP1\u03b1, and was shown to associate with PNUTS, a PP1-nuclear targeting subunit. Like endogenous PP1\u03b1, immunocomplexed 6His-HA-PP1\u03b1 is active toward phosphorylase a and the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB. When forcibly overexpressing 6His-HA-PP1\u03b1, there is a concomitant decrease in endogenous PP1\u03b1 levels. Conclusions : These data suggest the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP1\u03b1 protein levels and activity remain relatively constant. RT-PCR analyses of isolated polysome fractions support the notion that this putative autoregulatory mechanism is exerted, at least in part, at the translational level. Implications of these findings for the study of PP1\u03b1 function in vivo are discussed."

It specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this study, we have investigated the effects of geldanamycin on the regulation of Hsp90-dependent oncogenic signaling pathways directly implicated in cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human urinary bladder cancer cells. In order to assess the biological outcome of Hsp90 inhibition on RT4 (grade I) and T24 (grade III) human urinary bladder cancer cell lines, we applied MTT assay, FACS analysis, Western blotting, semi-quantitative (sq) RT-PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), immunofluorescence and scratch-wound assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: We have herein demonstrated that, upon geldanamycin treatment, bladder cancer cells are prominently arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle and eventually undergo programmed cell death via combined activation of apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, geldanamycin administration proved to induce prominent downregulation of several Hsp90 protein clients and downstream effectors, such as membrane receptors (IGF-IR and c-Met), protein kinases (Akt, IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and Erk1/2) and transcription factors (FOXOs and NF-\u03ba\u0392), therefore resulting in the impairment of proliferative -oncogenic- signaling and reduction of cell motility.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In toto, we have evinced the dose-dependent and cell line-specific actions of geldanamycin on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of critical Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling -oncogenic- integrity."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) are implicated in colorectal cancer carcinogenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The identification of these cells could help to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has been viewed as a marker for gastrointestinal stem cells that fuel the self-renewal process, however others view them as a marker of Tuft cells or as an enteroendocrine subtype. The purpose of this study was to use a colon cancer cell line to identify and characterize the stem-like characteristics of the DCLK1+ cell population. METHODS: To enrich stem-like cells, HCT116 cells (derived from colon adenocarcinomas) were cultured using serum-free media to form spheres under both normal oxygen and hypoxia condition. DCLK1 transcript expression in the adherent parental cells and spheroids was quantified using quantitative real time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction [(q)RT-PCR]. DCLK1 protein expression was determined using flow cytometry. Self-renewal capability from adherent parental cells and spheroids was determined using extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA). RESULTS: Under both normal oxygen and hypoxia condition, the adherent parental cells were composed of cells that express low levels of DCLK1. However, spheroids exhibited an increased frequency of cells expressing DCLK1 on both mRNA and protein levels. Cells derived from spheroids also possess stronger self-renewal capability. CONCLUSIONS: The higher fraction of DCLK1+ cells exhibited by spheroids and hypoxia reflects the stem-like characteristics of these cells. DCLK1 may represent an ideal marker to study and develop effective strategies to overcome chemo-resistance and relapse of colon cancer."

However, the mechanism by which ATO exerts its inhibitory effect on the proliferation of myeloma cells remains to be clarified. We study the inhibitory effect of ATO at various concentrations on the proliferation of the myeloma cell line RPMI 8226 and discussed the molecular mechanism of ATO on myeloma cell line. Our results proved that ATO had a significant dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the expressions of the Notch receptor (Notch1) and Notch ligand (Jag2). Data from the real-time PCR assay showed that the mRNA expression levels of the Jag2 gene and its downstream gene Hes1 were both significantly down-regulated after the myeloma cells were treated with ATO while the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was up-regulated. These results elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the ATO mediated inhibition of myeloma cell proliferation. This is the first report on the anti-myeloma activity in myeloma cells through inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway."

        "abstract": "Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types play a major role in the development of cervical cancer in vivo and can induce immortalization of primary human keratinocytes in vivo. Activation of the telomere-lengthening enzyme telomerase constitutes a key event in both processes. Because losses of alleles from chromosome 6 and increased telomerase activity have been observed in high-grade premalignant cervical lesions, we analyzed whether human chromosome 6 harbors a putative telomerase repressor locus that may be involved in HPV-mediated immortalization. Methods: Microcell-mediated chromosome transfer was used to introduce chromosomes 6 and 11 to the in vitro generated HPV type 16 (HPV16)-immortalized keratinocyte cell line FK16A and to the in vivo derived HPV16-containing cervical cancer cell line SiHa. Hybrid clones were analyzed for growth characteristics, telomerase activity, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and HPV16 E6 expression, and telomere length. FK16A hybrid clones were also transduced with an hTERT-containing retrovirus to examine the effect of ectopic hTERT expression on growth. Statistical tests were two-sided, Results: Introduction of human chromosome 6 but not of chromosome 11 to both cell lines yielded hybrid cells that demonstrated crisis-like features (i,e,, enlarged and flattened morphology, vacuolation, and multinucleation) and underwent growth arrest after a marked lag period. In the chromosome 6 hybrid clones analyzed, telomerase activity and hTERT messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were statistically significantly reduced compared with those in the chromosome 11 hybrid clones (for telomerase activity, P =.004 for the FK16A hybrids and P =.039 for the SiHa hybrids; for hTERT mRNA expression, P =.003 for the FK16A hybrids). The observed growth arrest was associated with telomeric shortening. Ectopic expression of hTERT in FK16A cells could prevent the telomeric shortening-based growth arrest induced by chromosome 6, Conclusions: Chromosome 6 may harbor a repressor of hTERT transcription, the loss of which may be involved in HPV-mediated immortalization."

Two studies in this issue of Cancer Cell present a novel integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 145 primary breast cancers and 51 established cell lines. Data from clinical tumors highlighted mechanisms of disease and facilitated identification of potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. An extensive well-characterized cancer cell line resource opens up opportunities to explore the determinants of cellular responses to existing and emerging therapies. Taken together, these studies illustrate how integrated molecular profiling may one day significantly impact diagnosis and therapeutic choice in human breast cancer."

        "abstract": "Background: Lycopene, a major carotenoid component of tomato, has a potential anticancer activity in many types of cancer. Epidemiological and clinical trials rarely provide evidence for mechanisms of the compound\u2019s action, and studies on its effect on cancer of different cell origins are now being done. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of lycopene on cell cycle and cell viability in eight human cancer cell lines. Methods: Human cell lines were treated with lycopene (1\u20135 \u03bcM) for 48 and 96 h. Cell viability was monitored using the method of MTT. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, and apoptotic cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick labeling (TUNEL) and by DAPI. Results: Our data showed a significant decrease in the number of viable cells in three cancer cells lines (HT-29, T84 and MCF-7) after 48 h treatment with lycopene, and changes in the fraction of cells retained in different cell cycle phases. Lycopene promoted also cell cycle arrest followed by decreased cell viability in majority of cell lines after 96 h, as compared to controls. Furthermore, an increase in apoptosis was observed in four cell lines (T-84, HT-29, MCF-7 and DU145) when cells were treated with lycopene. Conclusions: Our findings show the capacity of lycopene to inhibit cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle in different phases and increase apoptosis, mainly in breast, colon and prostate lines after 96 h. These observations suggest that lycopene may alter cell cycle regulatory proteins depending on the type of cancer and the dose of lycopene administration. Taken together, these data indicated that the antiproliferative effect of lycopene was cellular type, time and dose-dependent"

Previous studies showed that vanillin could enhance the repair of mutations and thus function as an antimutagen. However, its role in cancer, a disease that is closely related to mutation has not yet been fully elucidated. Hence, this study investigated the cytolytic and cytostatic properties of vanillin against HT-29, a human colorectal cancer cell line. Methods used including cell viability assay, acridine orange (AO)-ethidium bromide (EB) double staining cell morphol. anal., Cell cycle anal., annexin V-propidium iodide apoptosis test and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling cell proliferation assay. Results showed that apoptosis was induced by vanillin and the IC50 for HT-29 and NIH/3T3 normal cell lines were 400 \u03bcg/mL and 1000 \u03bcg/mL, resp. Different concns. of vanillin arrest cell cycle at different checkpoints. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine-labeling cell proliferation assay showed that G0/G1 arrest was achieved at lower concn. of vanillin (200 \u03bcg/mL) while cell cycle anal. by flow cytometer showed that G2/M arrest occurs at higher concn. of vanillin (1000 \u03bcg/mL). Cytolytic and cytostatic effects shown by vanillin showed that it could be a useful colorectal cancer preventive agent. Further in vivo study should be carried out to confirm that similar effects could happen in animals. [on SciFinder(R)]"

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in NBN, the gene for Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), are thought to predispose women to developing breast cancer, but a breast cancer cell line containing mutations in NBN has not yet been described. The p.R215W missense mutation occurs at sub-polymorphic frequencies in several populations. We aimed to investigate its functional impact in breast cancer cells from a carrier of this NBN mutation. METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were screened by immunoblotting for NBN protein levels, and the NBN coding region was sequenced for mutation analysis. Radiosensitivity assays and functional studies were performed through immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, and flow cytometry was employed to assess cell cycle progression. Impedance measurements were used to study the consequences of PARP1 inhibition. Statistical comparisons between cell lines were performed using t-tests. RESULTS: HCC1395 breast cancer cells exhibited reduced NBN protein levels. Direct sequencing identified the NBN p.R215W mutation in the hemizygous state, in addition to a truncation in BRCA1. Mutations in both genes were already present in the heterozygous state in the patient's germline. HCC1395 cells were highly radiosensitive, susceptible to apoptosis and were deficient in the formation of NBN foci. There was also evidence for some impairment in the formation of \u03b3H2AX, MDC1, and 53BP1 foci after irradiation; these foci appeared smaller and irregular compared with repair foci in wild-type cells, although ATM signalling was largely unaffected. In line with their deficiency in NBN and BRCA1, HCC1395 cells were particularly sensitive to PARP1 inhibition. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the p.R215W mutation in the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line impairs NBN function, making this cell line a potentially useful cellular model for studying defective NBN protein within a mutant BRCA1 background."

        "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease, often characterized by poor response to standard chemotherapy, which is mainly based on anthracyclines and taxanes. Thus, increasing tumor cell sensitivity to these agents is an attractive goal towards improving the clinical management of this disease. The present study investigates the effects of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) inhibition on the response of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line to doxorubicin (DOX). Stat3 is a transcription factor often constitutively activated in breast tumors and cancer cell lines, and is thought to contribute to malignant transformation and progression by transactivation of a host of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis and invasiveness. Our results indicate that (a) untreated MDA-MB-231 cells express higher baseline levels of (activated) pTyr(705)Stat3, that are further upregulated following exposure to DOX, than the non-metastatic MCF-7 cell line; (b) inhibiting the Stat3 signaling pathway, by exposure to the tyrphostin AG490 (an inhibitor of the upstream activating Janus kinases), by transfection with a dominant-negative form of Stat3 or by treatment with satraplatin (a tetravalent platinum derivative that inhibits Stat3 activation), increases breast cancer cell response to the proapoptotic effect of DOX (to different extents). In addition, the latter two approaches have been shown to interfere with expression of one or more antiapoptotic proteins. Overall, these observations suggest that suppression of Stat3 signaling may provide a potential therapeutic approach to overcoming DOX resistance in metastatic breast cancer cells. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Homeobox (HOX) genes deregulation has been largely implicated in the development of human leukemia. Among the HOXB cluster, HOXB1 was silent in a number of analyzed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary cells and cell lines, whereas it was expressed in normal terminally differentiated peripheral blood cells. METHODS: We evaluated the biological effects and the transcriptome changes determined by the retroviral transduction of HOXB1 in the human promyelocytic cell line HL60. RESULTS: Our results suggest that the enforced expression of HOXB1 reduces cell growth proliferation, inducing apoptosis and cell differentiation along the monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Accordingly, gene expression analysis showed the HOXB1-dependent down-regulation of some tumor promoting genes, paralleled by the up-regulation of apoptosis- and differentiation-related genes, thus supporting a tumor suppressor role for HOXB1 in AML. Finally, we indicated HOXB1 promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism responsible for HOXB1 silencing. CONCLUSIONS: We propose HOXB1 as an additional member of the HOX family with tumour suppressor properties suggesting a HOXB1/ATRA combination as a possible future therapeutic strategy in AML."

RESULTS: The data showed that As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited proliferation of GLC-82 cells and the inhibiting effects had a dose-and time-dependence. The cell proliferation inhibition rate was 81. 05% when treated with 4. 0 Lmol/L As(2)O(3) for 96 hours. The change of DNA content of GLC-82 cells indicated that As(2)O(3) was able to block cell cycle progress in G2/M phase, with appearance of sub-G1 peak in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: As(2)O(3) can effectively inhibit the proliferation of human lung cancer cell line GLC-82 and the possible mechanisms may be related to G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis induced by As(2)O(3)."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Taxol is a powerful chemotherapy agent leading to mitotic arrest and cell death; however, its clinical efficacy has been hampered due to the development of drug resistance. Taxol specifically targets the cell cycle. Progress through mitosis (M stage) is an absolute requirement for drug-induced death because cell death is markedly reduced in cells blocked at the G1-S transition. The measured doubling time for ovarian cancer cells is about 27 h. As such, during treatment with Taxol most of the cells are not in the M stage of the cell cycle. Thus, the effect of cell-cycle synchronization was investigated in regard to reversing Taxol resistance in ovarian cancer cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: Giemsa-Wright staining was used for assessing the morphology of the cells. The doubling time of the cells was calculated using formula as follows: Td\u2009=\u2009In2/slope. The resistant index and cell cycle were measured via MTT assays and flow cytometry. Thymidine was used to induce cell-cycle synchronization, and cell apoptosis rates following exposure to Taxol were measured using a flow cytometer.\\n\\nRESULTS: The growth doubling time of two Taxol-resistant cell lines were longer than that of Taxol-sensitive cells. Apoptotic rates in Taxol-sensitive and -resistant cell lines after synchronization and exposure to Taxol were all higher compared to unsynchronized controls (p <0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Synchronization of the cell-cycle resulted in an increased effectiveness of Taxol toward ovarian cancer cell lines. We speculated that formation of drug resistance toward Taxol in ovarian cancer could be partly attributed to the longer doubling time of these cells."

Terazosin, a long-acting selective \u03b11-adrenoreceptor antagonist, induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in an \u03b11-adrenoreceptor-independent manner, while genistein, a major soy isoflavone, inhibits the growth of several types of cancer cells. The present study was designed to test the therapeutic potential of a combination of terazosin and genistein using a metastatic, hormone-independent prostatic cancer cell line, DU-145. Terazosin or genistein treatment inhibited the growth of DU-145 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas had no effect on normal prostate epithelial cells. Addition of 1 \u03bcg/ml of terazosin, which was inactive alone, augmented the growth inhibitory effect of 5 \u03bcg/ml of genistein. Co-treatment with terazosin resulted in the genistein-induced arrest of DU-145 cells in G2/M phase being overridden and an increase in apoptotic cells, as evidenced by procaspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. The combination also caused a greater decrease in the levels of the apoptosis-regulating protein, Bcl-XL, and of VEGF165 and VEGF121 than genistein alone. In conclusion, the terazosin/genistein combination was more effective in inhibiting cell growth and VEGF expression as well as inducing apoptosis of the metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145, than either alone. The doses used in this study are in lower and nontoxic anticancer dosage range, suggesting this combination has potential for therapeutic use. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

METHODS: Molecular mechanisms of heptaplatin effective against cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines has been investigated in connection with metallothionein (MT). Cytotoxicity was determined by an MTT assay. MT mRNA, was determined by RT-PCR assay. Transfection study was carried out to examine the function of MT. RESULTS: Of various gastric cancer cell lines, SNU-638 and SNU-601 showed the highest and lowest levels of MT mRNA, respectively, showing 80-fold difference. The IC50 values of SNU-638 to cisplatin, carboplatin and heptaplatin were 11.2-fold, 5.1-fold and 2.0-fold greater than those of SNU-601, respectively. Heptaplatin was more effective against cisplatin-resistant and MT-transfected gastric cancer sublines than cisplatin or carboplatin was. In addition, heptaplatin attenuated cadmium, but not zinc, induction of MT. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that molecular mechanisms of heptaplatin effective against cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer sublines is at least in part due to the less involvement of MT in heptaplatin resistance as well as its attenuation of MT induction."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Androgens and androgen receptors (AR) regulate normal prostate development and growth. They also are involved in pathological development of prostatic diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). Antiandrogen therapy for PCa, in conjunction with chemical or surgical castration, offers initial positive responses and leads to massive prostate cell death. However, cancer cells later appear as androgen-independent PCa. To investigate the role of AR in prostate cell proliferation and survival, we introduced a vector-based small interfering RNA (siRNA). This siRNA targeted 5'-untranslated region of AR mRNA for extended suppression of AR expression in androgen-sensitive human prostate LNCaP cells. RESULTS: The siRNA design successfully suppressed endogenous AR expression, as revealed by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells did not proliferate in the absence of AR and underwent apoptosis, based on elevated phospho-Histone H2B expression and higher number of apoptotic body as compared to control cells. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that AR is vital for prostate cell proliferation and survival in this androgen-sensitive prostate cell line. These results further strengthen the hypothesis that AR can be a therapeutic target for treating androgen-sensitive stages of PCa. Unlike antiandorgens, however, siRNA targeting AR provides a direct inactivation of AR function through the suppression of AR protein expression."

Before surgical resection, the white blood cell and platelet counts were elevated to 34,400/mm3 and 668,000/mm3, respectively, and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level in the serum was increased at 141 pg/mL. The primary tumor showed an undifferentiated morphology with large cells and induced extensive thickening of the pleura in the right hemithorax. The Y-ML-1B cells grow as a monolayer, with a doubling time of 19 hours, and are tumorigenic in nude mice, which showed a morphology similar to the primary tumor in xenografts. Analysis of the supernatant of cell culture medium of Y-ML-1B showed elevated levels of G-CSF and other cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), consistent with the high levels detected in the patient's serum. Cytogenetic analysis revealed aneuploidy of greater than 56 in metaphases with many structural abnormalities. Mutation analysis of the tumor suppressor genes showed that Y-ML-1B is inactivated in TP53 and RASSF1A, but not in p14ARF, p16INK4A, or RB. Neither activating mutations of KRAS or NRAS nor amplification of MYC or MDM2 were detected. Y-ML-1B expressed N-cadherin but not E-cadherin.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent hepatic cancer worldwide. Currently, a targeted therapy via monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to tumor-associated antigen is undergoing continual development in HCC treatment. METHODS: In this regard, after establishing and consequently exploring Hep88 mAb's tumoricidal effect on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cell line), the Hep88 mAb's specific antigens from both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of HepG2 cell line were identified by 2-D gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis. After in-gel digestion and subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), mortalin (HSPA9) and alpha-enolase were identified. The recombinant proteins specific to Hep88 mAb were cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Moreover, alteration of HepG2 and Chang liver cell line after being induced by Hep88 mAb for 1-3 days was investigated using a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: The result demonstrated that Hep88 mAb can bind to the recombinant mortalin (HSPA9) and alpha-enolase. In addition, the gradual appearing of mitochondria vacuolization and endoplasmic reticulum dilatation were observed. Those characteristics might be explained by the paraptosis-like program cell death (PCD), which is induced by the binding of Hep88 mAb to mortalin (HSPA9). Mortalin depletion resulting from the formation of Hep88 mAb-mortalin (HSPA9) complex might initiate transcription-independence of p53-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, Hep88mAb-alpha-enolase complex might initiate HepG2 cells energy exhaustion by glycolysis pathway obstruction. CONCLUSION: These fascinating results imply that Hep88 mAb might be a promising tool for the development of an effective treatment of HCC in the next decade."

His disease remained chemo-refractory, and died six months after relapse.\\n\\nMETHODS: Purified mononuclear cells from the pleural effusion of the patient were cultured in the presence of IL-6. Continually growing cells were characterized by morphological, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and TP53 mutation analyses. Cell proliferation was measured and compared with other myeloma cell lines by cell counting at day 3, 6, 9, and 12. Drug resistance against bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor approved as a frontline chemotherapy for eligible myeloma patients, was evaluated and compared with other myeloma cell lines by MTT assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: Immunophenotypic analysis of the myeloma cells confirmed strong expression of plasma cell markers CD38 and CD138 but not T-cell or natural killer-cell marker CD56. Cytogenetic analysis of the myeloma cells showed a hypodiploid composite karyotype including loss of chromosome 13 and 17 or deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17, i.e. del(17p), in the form of isochromosome 17q10. FISH confirmed a hypodiploid karyotype with TP53 deletion but absence of t(4;14). Sequencing analysis of the TP53 gene indicated absence of mutation. Cell counting revealed that the maximum viable cell density was about 2.5 X 106 cells/ml. Upon bortezomib treatment, MTT assay reported an IC50 of 72.17nM, suggesting a strong bortezomib resistance.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: A hypodiploid with loss of chromosome 13 and loss or del(17p) human myeloma cell line, MMLAL, was established from the pleural effusion of a Chinese myeloma patient."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been proved that methylseleninic acid (MSA) is a kind of artificially developed selenium compound, which appeared to be the best candidate for cancer prevention and therapy. Reduced glutathione is not only critical to MSA metabolism, but also is a kind of protective antioxidant which could remove the oxygen free radical promptly and maintain the intracellular redox status stable. The aim of this study is to explore the anticancer effects of ROS induced by MSA and the molecular mechanisms of MSA on induction of ROS. METHODS: We confirmed that MSA and selenite have the anticancer effect in the human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981 by growth inhibition detection, we detect the ROS induced by MSA and selenite in L9981 by fluorescence microscopy, and use flow cytometry to quantitate the ROS induced by NAC together with selenium compounds. RESULTS: (1)MSA 2.5 muM and 5.0 muM selenite could inhibit the L9981 growth, Increasing the concentration resulted in a more pronounced effect. (2)MSA and selenite could induce ROS in L9981. (3)incubated NAC with selenite could significantly inhibit the ROS but increase the ROS treated by NAC with MSA. CONCLUSIONS: (1)MSA and selenite had anti-L9981 effect. (2)Oxidative stress reaction may participate in the induction of apoptosis by MSA and selenite in lung cancer cell line L9981."

        "abstract": "The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 plays a major role in the DNA damage response pathway. The lack of well-characterized human BRCA1-null cell lines has limited the investigation of BRCA1 function, particularly with regard to its role in ovarian cancer. We propagated a novel BRCA1-null human ovarian cancer cell line UWB1.289 from a tumor of papillary serous histology, the most common form of ovarian carcinoma. UWB1.289 carries a germline BRCA1 mutation within exon 11 and has a deletion of the wild-type allele. UWB1.289 is estrogen and progesterone receptor negative and has an acquired somatic mutation in p53, similar to the commonly used BRCA1-null breast cancer cell line HCC1937. We used ionizing radiation to induce DNA damage in both UWB1.289 and in a stable UWB1.289 line in which wild-type BRCA1 was restored. We examined several responses to DNA damage in these cell lines, including sensitivity to radiation, cell cycle checkpoint function, and changes in gene expression using microarray analysis. We observed that UWB1.289 is sensitive to ionizing radiation and lacks cell cycle checkpoint functions that are a normal part of the DNA damage response. Restoration of wild-type BRCA1 function in these cells partially restores DNA damage responses. Expression array analysis not only supports this partial functional correction but also reveals interesting new information regarding BRCA1-positive regulation of the expression of claudin 6 and other metastasis-associated genes and negative regulation of multiple IFN-inducible genes."

Cell lines are widely used in laboratory research and particularly as in vitro models in cancer research. But we found that the routinely used breast cancer cell lines were mostly derived from Caucasians or African-Americans. There were few standard models to study the pathogenic mechanism at molecular level and cell signaling pathway of breast cancer for Asian patients. It is quite necessary to establish new breast cancer cell lines from xanthoderm to study the pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic methods. RESULTS: Three new breast cancer cell lines, designated BC-019, BC-020 and BC-021, were successfully established and characterized from breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissues of three Chinese female patients. These new cell lines growing as adherent monolayer with characteristic epithelial morphology could be maintained continuously in vitro, and they were ER-, PR- and C-erbB-2-positive. Their chromosomes showed high hyperdiploidy and complex rearrangements, and they displayed aggressive tumorigencity in tumorigenesis test. CONCLUSION: The three newly established breast cancer cell lines from Chinese patients were tested for a number of, and the results indicate that the cell lines were in good quality and could be served as new cell models in breast cancer study."

        "abstract": "Tumor proliferation, drug resistance and cell stemness are major difficulties that are encountered during breast cancer therapy and are often responsible for disease progression and cancer-related mortality. \u03b2-catenin is considered to be an invasion gene in breast cancer. However, how \u03b2-catenin regulates breast cancer cell proliferation and stemness remains unclear. In the present study, \u03b2-catenin knockdown by small interfering RNA in MDA-MB-468, a highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, inhibited the expression of \u03b2-catenin, Oct3/4 (stemness), survivin (anti-apoptosis) and BCRP (drug resistance). Knockdown of \u03b2-catenin enhanced the effects of fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy on the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells. Thus, these preliminary results indicate that \u03b2-catenin knockdown enhanced 5-FU-induced proliferation inhibition in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468, and indicate that combining 5-FU with gene silencing could be an advantageous option for enhancing the curative effect of chemotherapy in breast cancer and other malignancies."

        "abstract": "The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) represents a collaborative effort to assemble a comprehensive resource of human cancer models for basic and translational research. Thus far, the CCLE contains high-density SNP array data, gene expression microarray data and selected cancer gene mutation data for approximately 1,000 human cancer cell lines spanning many tumor types. Additionally, we are assessing the sensitivity of these same cell lines using a series of pharmacological compounds that represent both conventional cytotoxic and targeted agents. Another goal of the CCLE collaboration involves systematic integration of the genomic and pharmacologic datasets in order to identify putative targets of prevalent genetic alterations as well as predictors and modifiers of pharmacologic sensitivity and resistance. The availability of high-quality data generated by uniform criteria across hundreds of cell lines markedly enhances the statistical power to discover genetic alterations involved in carcinogenesis and molecular predictors of pharmacologic vulnerability.As proof of principle, we have carried out systematic nomination of putative targets of genetic alterations using integrative analyses. Here, significant regions of genomic gains and losses have been linked to expression and mutation data to find significant correlations at both single-gene and pathway levels. We have also begun to assemble systematic algorithms that identify genetic predictors of sensitivity or resistance to particular pharmacological compounds, taking advantage of the fact that the CCLE is a comprehensive resource with extensive genomic characterization. Toward this end, we integrated a preliminary sensitivity dataset for 28 compounds accurately profiled against more than 400 cell lines with all genomic data available in the CCLE. To enhance the robustness of our method, we reduced the number of significant genomic features for each cell line to a number that allows properly determined prediction of sensitivity. Expression data was converted to cell line-specific readouts of gene set expression; and DNA gains and losses are reduced to statistically significant regions using the GISTIC algorithm. These values were combined with critical oncogene mutations as inputs to a multifaceted prediction model for pharmacological sensitivity, the accuracy of which was assessed using cross-validation. Our results suggest that this integrative approach applied to a robust cancer cell line collection has considerable power to discover novel associations that augment ongoing basic research into cancer biology and drug discovery.Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anticancer research resulted in the discovery of a promising antimitotic metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol. 2-Methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate, a bis-sulphamoylated analogue exerts antiproliferative- and antimitotic activity. Investigating the anticancer potential of 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate requires demonstrating the influence of 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate on non-tumorigenic cells. This project focused on the in vitro effects of 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate on the non-tumorigenic MCF-12A breast epithelial cell line. METHODS: The in vitro influence of 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate was investigated on cell cycle progression, possible induction of apoptosis and autophagy and reactive oxygen species generation. Cell cycle progression was done using flow cytometry in conjunction with ethanol fixation and propidium iodide staining. Displaying effects on the mitochondrial membrane potential was achieved utilizing flow cytometry and the MitoCapture TM Mitochondrial apoptosis detection kit. Autophagy detection was done by means of flow cytometry and anti-LC3B conjugated to DyLight 488. Reactive oxygen species generation was conducted employing flow cytometry and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and hydroethidine. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate did not affect cell cycle progression or reactive oxygen species in a statistically significant manner in the non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cell line. In addition, 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate did not statistically significantly induce apoptosis or autophagy. CONCLUSION: Reports indicate that 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate induces apoptosis and autophagy in several tumorigenic cell lines. The anticancer ability of 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate is due to its antimitotic activity. However, this study demonstrates the promising notion that 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate does not affect the non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cells. This project contributes to the embedded scientific knowledge regarding the differential death mechanisms used by 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate on tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines."

        "abstract": "Because cells are sensitive to mechanical forces, weightlessness might act on stress-dependent cell changes. Human breast cancer cells MCF-7, flown in space in a Photon capsule, were fixed after 1.5, 22 and 48 h in orbit. Cells subjected to weightlessness were compared to 1 g in-flight and ground controls. Post-flight, fluorescent labeling was performed to visualize cell proliferation (Ki-67), three cytoskeleton components and chromatin structure. Confocal microscopy and image analysis were used to quantify cycling cells and mitosis, modifications of the cytokeratin network and chromatin structure. Several main phenomena were observed in weightlessness: The perinuclear cytokeratin network and chromatin structure were looser; More cells were cycling and mitosis was prolonged. Finally, cell proliferation was reduced as a consequence of a cell-cycle blockade; Microtubules were altered in many cells. The results reported in the first point are in agreement with basic predictions of cellular tensegrity. The prolongation of mitosis can be explained by an alteration of microtubules. We discuss here the different mechanisms involved in weightlessness alteration of microtubules: i) alteration of their self-organization by reaction-diffusion processes, and a mathematical model is proposed, ii) activation or deactivation of microtubules stabilizing proteins, acting on both microtubule and microfilament networks in cell cortex."

Spontaneously transformed mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells may provide a faithful animal model for human ovarian cancer. One such cell line (ID8) has been partially characterized. ID8 cells demonstrate constitutive Src tyrosine kinase activation with resulting phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activation and Akt and forkhead phosphorylation. In addition, focal adhesion kinase is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine 925, a Src phosphorylation site, resulting in increased Ras activation. These features are common to human ovarian cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Src enhances the cell killing effects of both paclitaxel and cisplatinum. Finally, Src inhibition restores sensitivity of a drug resistant ID8 cell line.

        "abstract": "Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have recently been described in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who achieve radiographic regressions to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib. One of these mutations, L858R (Leu-->Arg), is also found in NSCLC cell line H3255, which is very sensitive to gefitinib treatment. We characterized nine NSCLC cell lines (three isolated from patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and six isolated from patients with adenocarcinoma) for their in vitro sensitivity to gefitinib. Of these, only H3255 (EGFR(L858R)) and H1666 (EGFR(WT)) are sensitive to gefitinib with IC(50) values of 40 nmol/L and 2 micromol/L, respectively. We examined the effects of gefitinib on H3255 and cell lines containing wild-type EGFR that are either sensitive (H1666) or resistant (A549 and H441) to gefitinib exposure in vitro. Gefitinib treatment (1 micromol/L) leads to significant apoptosis accompanied by increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage only in the H3255 cell line, leads to G(1)-S arrest in H1666, and has no effects in the A549 and H441 cell lines. Although EGFR and AKT are constitutively phosphorylated in H3255, H1666, and H441 cell lines, AKT is completely inhibited by gefitinib treatment only in the H3255 cell line. These findings further characterize a mechanism by which gefitinib treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR(L858R) leads to a dramatic response to gefitinib."

Proapoptotic genes such as STK17A and BNIP3 were significantly downregulated, whereas the genes PSAP and GDIA1, which were involved in antiapoptosis, were overexpressed. Moreover, the THC8307/L-OHP cells are also resistant to the other anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, and the expression levels of the differentially regulated genes such as S100P, CAeta, STA15, TCF8 are constantly maintained. These results provide clues for understanding the oxaliplatin-resistant mechanisms and imply markers to predict drug sensitivities for 'personalized chemotherapy'."

        "abstract": "Insights into the molecular basis of hormone-refractory prostate cancer have principally relied on human prostate cancer cell lines, all of which were derived from patients who had already failed hormonal therapy. Recent progress in developing genetically engineered mouse prostate cancer models provides an opportunity to isolate novel cell lines from animals never exposed to hormone ablation, avoiding any potential bias conferred by the selective pressure of the castrate environment. Here we report the isolation of such a cell line (Myc-CaP) from a c-myc transgenic mouse with prostate cancer. Myc-CaP cells have an amplified androgen receptor gene despite no prior exposure to androgen withdrawal and they retain androgen-dependent transgene expression as well as androgen-dependent growth in soft agar and in mice. Reexpression of c-Myc from a hormone-independent promoter rescues growth in androgen-depleted agar but not in castrated mice, showing a clear distinction between the molecular requirements for hormone-refractory growth in vitro versus in vivo. Myc-CaP cells represent a unique reagent for dissecting discreet steps in hormone-refractory prostate cancer progression and show the general utility of using genetically engineered mouse models for establishing new prostate cancer cell lines."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States. Although the causes of this disease are incompletely understood, oxidative DNA damage is presumed to play a critical role in breast carcinogenesis. A common oxidatively induced DNA lesion is 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua), which has been implicated in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of HCC1937 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines to repair 8-OH-Gua relative to a nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cell line, AG11134.\\n\\nMETHODS: We used oligonucleotide incision assay to analyze the ability of the two breast cancer cell lines to incise 8-OH-Gua relative to the control cell line. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to measure the levels of 8-OH-Gua as its nucleoside, 8-OH-dG in the cell lines after exposure to H2O2 followed by 30 min repair period. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot analysis, while the hOGG1 mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. Complementation of hOGG1 activity in HCC1937 cells was assessed by addition of the purified protein in the incision assay, and in vivo by transfection of pFlagCMV-4-hOGG1. Clonogenic survival assay was used to determine sensitivity after H2O2-mediated oxidative stress.\\n\\nRESULTS: We show that the HCC1937 breast cancer cells have diminished ability to incise 8-OH-Gua and they accumulate higher levels of 8-OH-dG in the nuclear genome after H2O2 treatment despite a 30 min repair period when compared to the nonmalignant mammary cells. The defective incision of 8-OH-Gua was consistent with expression of undetectable amounts of hOGG1 in HCC1937 cells. The reduced incision activity was significantly stimulated by addition of purified hOGG1. Furthermore, transfection of pFlagCMV-4-hOGG1 in HCC1937 cells resulted in enhanced incision of 8-OH-Gua. HCC1937 cells are more sensitive to high levels of H2O2 and have up-regulated SOD1 and SOD2.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for inefficient repair of 8-OH-Gua in HCC1937 breast cancer cell line and directly implicates hOGG1 in this defect."

        "abstract": "This study aims at developing new organoselenium compounds with good anticancer ability and low biotoxicity. Sucrose selenious ester (sucrose-Se) was synthesized by the reaction between sucrose and selenium oxychloride. MTT assay showed that sucrose-Se effectively inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cell line HeLa in a dose-dependent manner without cytostatic influence on human normal liver cell line HL-7702. Morphological observation and agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that sucrose-Se induced apoptosis to HeLa cells. In addition, sucrose-Se was able to inhibit proliferation of bladder carcinoma cell line 5637, human malignant melanoma cell line A375, and gastric carcinoma cell line MGC-803. Median lethal dose of sucrose-Se and sodium selenite was 290.0 and 13.1 ppm, respectively, in the acute toxicity test on mice. In conclusion, sucrose-Se has potential in cancer chemoprevention due its apoptosis induction capacity and low biotoxicity."

        "title": "Acetoacetate reduces growth and ATP concentration in cancer cell lines which over-express uncoupling protein 2.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that several human cancers are capable of uncoupling of mitochondrial ATP generation in the presence of intact tricarboxylic acid (TCA) enzymes. The goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis that ketone bodies can inhibit cell growth in aggressive cancers and that expression of uncoupling protein 2 is a contributing factor. The proposed mechanism involves inhibition of glycolytic ATP production via a Randle-like cycle while increased uncoupling renders cancers unable to produce compensatory ATP from respiration. METHODS: Seven aggressive human cancer cell lines, and three control fibroblast lines were grown in vitro in either 10 mM glucose medium (GM), or in glucose plus 10 mM acetoacetate [G+AcA]. The cells were assayed for cell growth, ATP production and expression of UCP2. RESULTS: There was a high correlation of cell growth with ATP concentration (r = 0.948) in a continuum across all cell lines. Controls demonstrated normal cell growth and ATP with the lowest density of mitochondrial UCP2 staining while all cancer lines demonstrated proportionally inhibited growth and ATP, and over-expression of UCP2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Seven human cancer cell lines grown in glucose plus acetoacetate medium showed tightly coupled reduction of growth and ATP concentration. The findings were not observed in control fibroblasts. The observed over-expression of UCP2 in cancer lines, but not in controls, provides a plausible molecular mechanism by which acetoacetate spares normal cells but suppresses growth in cancer lines. The results bear on the hypothesized potential for ketogenic diets as therapeutic strategies."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a major malignancy affecting females worldwide. It is the most common cause of death from cancer in women. Cell lines are widely used in laboratory research and particularly as in vitro models in cancer research. But we found that the routinely used breast cancer cell lines were mostly derived from Caucasians or African-Americans. There were few standard models to study the pathogenic mechanism at molecular level and cell signaling pathway of breast cancer for Asian patients. It is quite necessary to establish new breast cancer cell lines from xanthoderm to study the pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic methods. RESULTS: Three new breast cancer cell lines, designated BC-019, BC-020 and BC-021, were successfully established and characterized from breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissues of three Chinese female patients. These new cell lines growing as adherent monolayer with characteristic epithelial morphology could be maintained continuously in vitro, and they were ER-, PR- and C-erbB-2-positive. Their chromosomes showed high hyperdiploidy and complex rearrangements, and they displayed aggressive tumorigencity in tumorigenesis test. CONCLUSION: The three newly established breast cancer cell lines from Chinese patients were tested for a number of, and the results indicate that the cell lines were in good quality and could be served as new cell models in breast cancer study."

        "abstract": "The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 plays a major role in the DNA damage response pathway. The lack of well-characterized human BRCA1-null cell lines has limited the investigation of BRCA1 function, particularly with regard to its role in ovarian cancer. We propagated a novel BRCA1-null human ovarian cancer cell line UWB1.289 from a tumor of papillary serous histology, the most common form of ovarian carcinoma. UWB1.289 carries a germline BRCA1 mutation within exon 11 and has a deletion of the wild-type allele. UWE11.289 is estrogen and progesterone receptor negative and has an acquired somatic mutation in p53, similar to the commonly used BRCA1-null breast cancer cell line HCC11937. We used ionizing radiation to induce DNA damage in both UWB1.289 and in a stable UWB1.289 line in which wild-type BRCA1 was restored. We examined several responses to DNA damage in these cell lines, including sensitivity to radiation, cell cycle checkpoint function, and changes in gene expression using microarray analysis. We observed that UWB1.289 is sensitive to ionizing radiation and lacks cell cycle checkpoint functions that are a normal part of the DNA damage response. Restoration of wild-type BRCA1 function in these cells partially restores DNA damage responses. Expression array analysis not only supports this partial functional correction but also reveals interesting new information regarding BRCA1-positive regulation of the expression of claudin 6 and other metastasis-associated genes and negative regulation of multiple IFN-inducible genes."

        "abstract": "Caspase-2 can induce apoptosis in response to extrinsic and intrinsic signals. Unlike other caspases, this protein is not expressed solely in nonnuclear compartments; a subpopulation is constitutively localized in the nucleus. As one of the most evolutionarily conserved caspases, caspase-2 may have roles in multiple cellular processes. However, its contribution to nonapoptotic processes remains a mystery. In this study, we show that caspase-2 activity is important for proliferation by cells of the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. LNCaP cells expressing either a dominant-negative (dn) form of caspase or an siRNA against caspase-2 had lower androgen receptor (AR)-dependent proliferative responses than control cells, and application of the siRNA resulted in downregulation of the expression of both AR-dependent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and AR-dependent reporter luciferase. Also, caspase-2 formed complexes with the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D3, CDK4, and p21/Cip1, and caspase-2 regulated AR transactivation by inhibiting the repressive function of cyclin D3. Taken together, these results reveal, for the first time, that caspase-2 is involved in cell cycle promotion and AR activation. Given that prostate cancer cells depend on AR activity in order to survive, the fact that our data indicate that caspase-2 positively regulates AR activity suggests that caspase-2 has potential as a target in the treatment of prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "Persistent infection of Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) was associated with gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, but the mechanisms were not well understood. Herein, we found that M. hyorhinis activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling axis in gastric cancer cell lines. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was upstream of PI3K-AKT signaling in the context of M. hyorhinis infection, because phosphorylation of AKT Serine 473 was almost completely attenuated by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or by EGFR knockdown. Phosphorylation of AKT S473 induced by M. hyorhinis infection was also abolished by PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, we found that p37, a membrane protein of M. hyorhinis, could also promote M. hyorhinis-induced PI3K-AKT signaling activation and cell migration. In addition, pre-treatment with AG1478 or wortmannin significantly inhibited cell migration induced by M. hyorhinis infection or p37 treatment. In conclusion, EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling plays an important role in M. hyorhinis-promoted cell migration in gastric cancer cells, thus providing a clue to the pathogenesis of M. hyorhinis in gastric cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neural recognition molecule L1CAM, which is a key protein involved in early nervous system development, is known to be abnormally expressed and shed in several types of cancers where it participates in metastasis and progression. The distinction of L1CAM presence in cancerous vs. normal tissues has suggested it to be a new target for cancer treatment. Our current study focused on the potential role of soluble L1CAM in breast cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, migration, and invasion.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found L1 expression levels were correlated with breast cancer stage of progression in established data sets of clinical samples, and also were high in more metastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, but low in less migratory MDA-MB-468 cells. Proteolysis of L1 into its soluble form (sL1) was detected in cell culture medium from all three above cell lines, and can be induced by PMA activation. Over-expression of the L1 ectodomain in MDA-MB-468 cells by using a lentiviral vector greatly increased the amount of sL1 released by those cells. Concomitantly, cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and cell transmigration ability were significantly promoted, while cell invasion ability through Matrigel\u2122 remained unaffected. On the other hand, attenuating L1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by using a shRNA lentiviral vector resulted in reduced cell-matrix adhesion and transmigration. Similar effects were also shown by monoclonal antibody blocking of the L1 extracellular region. Moreover, sL1 in conditioned cell culture medium induced a directional migration of MDA-MB-468 cells, which could be neutralized by antibody treatment.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data provides new evidence for the function of L1CAM and its soluble form in promoting cancer cell adhesion to ECM and cell migration. Thus, L1CAM is validated further to be a potential early diagnostic marker in breast cancer progression and a target for breast cancer therapy."

Confluent monolayers of human gastric cancer cell line MKN45 were either treated or untreated with hyperthermia for 1 h. The cells were subsequently stimulated with TNF-alpha. A 24-h incubation with TNF-alpha did not affect cell viabilities; however, pretreatment with hyperthermia significantly enhanced the level of apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha. Pretreating MKN45 cells with hyperthermia (42.0 degrees C) significantly inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced increase in the binding activity of NF-kappaB to DNA. This study suggests that hyperthermia can inhibit the TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and that hyperthermia renders human gastric cancer cells susceptible to the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, possibly via inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway."

A 24-h incubation with TNF-?? did not affect cell viabilities; however, pretreatment with hyperthermia significantly enhanced the level of apoptosis induced by TNF-??. Pretreating MKN45 cells with hyperthermia (42.0 ??C) significantly inhibited the TNF-??-induced increase in the binding activity of NF-??B to DNA. This study suggests that hyperthermia can inhibit the TNF-??-induced NF-??B activation and that hyperthermia renders human gastric cancer cells susceptible to the TNF-??-induced apoptosis, possibly via inhibition of the NF-??B pathway. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have recently been described in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who achieve radiographic regressions to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib. One of these mutations, L858R (Leu-->Arg), is also found in NSCLC cell line H3255, which is very sensitive to gefitinib treatment. We characterized nine NSCLC cell lines (three isolated from patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and six isolated from patients with adenocarcinoma) for their in vitro sensitivity to gefitinib. Of these, only H3255 (EGFR(L858R)) and H1666 (EGFR(WT)) are sensitive to gefitinib with IC(50) values of 40 nmol/L and 2 micromol/L, respectively. We examined the effects of gefitinib on H3255 and cell lines containing wild-type EGFR that are either sensitive (H1666) or resistant (A549 and H441) to gefitinib exposure in vitro. Gefitinib treatment (1 micromol/L) leads to significant apoptosis accompanied by increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage only in the H3255 cell line, leads to G(1)-S arrest in H1666, and has no effects in the A549 and H441 cell lines. Although EGFR and AKT are constitutively phosphorylated in H3255, H1666, and H441 cell lines, AKT is completely inhibited by gefitinib treatment only in the H3255 cell line. These findings further characterize a mechanism by which gefitinib treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR(L858R) leads to a dramatic response to gefitinib."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the mainstay treatment for colorectal cancer for the past few decades. However, as with other cancers, development of 5-FU resistance has been a major obstacle in colorectal cancer chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to gain further understanding of the mechanisms underlying 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A 5-FU-resistant cell line was established from the human colon cancer cell line SNU-769A. Protein extracts from these two cell lines (parent and resistant) were analyzed using comparative proteomics to identify differentially expressed proteins. RESULTS: 5-FU-resistant human colon cancer cells were found to overexpress metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4). Other experiments showed cellular resistance to 5-FU (i.e., cell survival) was altered by the mGluR4 agonist l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP 4), and by the mGluR4 antagonist (S)-amino-2-methyl-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (MAP 4), in that L-AP 4 increased 5-FU resistance in SNU-769A cells, whereas MAP 4 ablated 5-FU resistance in 5-FU-resistant cells. However, there was no significant effect of L-AP 4 or MAP 4 on basal cAMP and thymidylate synthase levels. Interestingly, 5-FU down-regulated mGluR4 expression, and MAP 4 suppressed proliferation in both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: We here report mGluR4 expression in human colon cancer cell line, which provides further evidence for extra-central nervous system expression of glutamate receptors. Overexpression of mGluR4 may tentatively be responsible for 5-FU resistance and, although activation by agonist promotes cell survival in the presence of 5-FU, decreased mGluR4 expression or inactivation by antagonist contributes to cell death."

        "abstract": "The D2 dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine has been used clinically for reducing tumor mass of pituitary adenomas arising from lactotroph origins. As well, bromocriptine has been shown to have an antiproliferative effect on primary lactotrophs and lactotroph-derived cell lines. The presence of D2 dopamine-like receptors on NCI-H69 cells was previously established by the use of [(125)I]iodosulpride binding and has been confirmed in this study by use of reverse transcription PCR with receptor-specific primers. The reverse transcription PCR analysis of NCI-H69 cells demonstrates that both the D2s and D2l are expressed in NCI-H69 cells, with D2s having the higher relative expression. The activation of the D2R results in an inhibition of growth of NCI-H69 cells as assessed by the incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine; a process not sensitive to pertussis toxin. In NCI-H69 cells, the D2 dopamine-like receptor is coupled to the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and to the stimulation of phospholipase D. The receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation is ablated by overnight treatment with pertussis toxin but the stimulation of phospholipase D mediated by dopaminergic agonists is not. These data suggest that the phospholipase D pathway is responsible for the antiproliferative effects of D2 dopamine-like receptors agonists in small cell lung cancer cells. In support of this hypothesis, the inhibition of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation mediated by dopaminergic agonists was shown to be sensitive to the presence of ethanol. Taken together, these data suggest that the D2 dopamine-like receptor activates phospholipase D, which ultimately leads to an inhibition of growth of this small cell lung cancer cell line."

        "abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been found to display anticancer activity against many types of tumors and has been developed into an anticancer drug in clinical treatments. Sphingolipids are membrane lipids that participate in many signal transduction pathways. In this paper, the changes in sphingolipids of the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 treated with arsenic trioxide were investigated using an HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Analytes were separated by an XBridge BEH C8 column used for Cer, HexCer, LacCer and SM chromatographic separation, and a Capcell PAK MG II C18 column was used for Sph, dhSph, S1P and dhS1P chromatographic separation and gradient elution with acetonitrile-water containing 0.1% formic acid as a mobile phase. A tandem mass spectrometer QTrap in SRM mode was employed in combination with RPLC as a detector for quantitative analysis. The ceramide/sphingolipid internal standard (IS) mixture was used to quantify the levels of sphingolipids. The distributions of sphingolipids were found to be different in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803. Ceramide (Cer), hexosylceramide (HexCer) and dihexosylceramide (Hex2Cer) levels in U266 cell line are higher than those in MGC-803 cell line. Additionally, sphingomyelin (SM), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and sphinganine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) levels in the MGC-803 cell line are higher than those in the U266 cell line. When treated with arsenic trioxide (1-5??M iAsIII(AsIII ions)), the levels of Hex2Cer in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 decreased, and the levels of S1P and dhS1P in the human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 decreased. The decrease of Hex2Cer, S1P and dhS1P in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 were observed when the concentration of iAsIII is 1.0??M. Therefore, arsenic trioxide exhibits anti-cancer activity by altering the sphingolipid pathway in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 5-AzaCytidine (AzaC) is a DNA demethylating drugs that has been shown to inhibit cell growth and to induce apoptosis in certain cancer cells. Induced expression of the galectin1 (Gal1) protein, a galactoside-binding protein distributed widely in immune cells, has been described in cultured hepatoma-derived cells treated with AzaC and this event may have a role in the effect of the drug. According to this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of AzaC and Gal1 on human lymphoid B cells phenotype. METHODS: The effect of AzaC and Gal1 on cell growth and phenotype was determined on the Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL36. An immunocytochemical analysis for detection of Gal1 protein expression was performed in AzaC-treated cells. To investigate the direct effects of Gal1, recombinant Gal1 was added to cells. RESULTS: Treatment of lymphoid B cells with AzaC results in: i) a decrease in cell growth with an arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, ii) phenotypic changes consistent with a differentiated phenotype, and iii) the expression of p16, a tumor-suppressor gene whose expression was dependent of its promoter demethylation, and of Gal1. A targeting of Gal 1 to the plasma membrane follows its cytosolic expression. To determine which of the effects of AzaC might be secondary to the induction of Gal1, recombinant Gal1 was added to BL36 cells. Treated cells displayed growth inhibition and phenotypic changes consistent with a commitment toward differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Altered cell growth and expression of the cell surface plasma cell antigen, CD138 are detectable in BL36 cells treated by AzaC as well as by Gal1. It seems that AzaC-induced Gal1 expression and consequent binding of Gal1 on its cell membrane receptor may be, in part, involved in AzaC-induced plasmacytic differentiation."

        "abstract": "A challenge in achieving optimal management of cancer is the discovery of secreted biomarkers that represent useful surrogates for the disease and could be measured noninvasively. Because of the problems encountered in the proteomic interrogation of plasma, secretomes have been proposed as an alternative source of tumor markers that might be enriched with secreted proteins relevant to the disease. However, secretome analysis faces analytical challenges that interfere with the search for true secreted tumor biomarkers. Here, we have addressed two of the main challenges of secretome analysis in comparative discovery proteomics. First, we carried out a kinetics experiment whereby secretomes and lysates of tumor cells were analyzed to monitor cellular viability during secretome production. Interestingly, the proteomic signal of a group of secreted proteins correlated well with the apoptosis induced by serum starvation and could be used as an internal cell viability marker. We then addressed a second challenge relating to contamination of serum proteins in secretomes caused by the required use of serum for tumor cell culture. The comparative proteomic analysis between cell lines labeled with SILAC showed a number of false positives coming from serum and that several proteins are both in serum and being secreted from tumor cells. A thorough study of secretome methodology revealed that under optimized experimental conditions there is a substantial fraction of proteins secreted through unconventional secretion in secretomes. Finally, we showed that some of the nuclear proteins detected in secretomes change their cellular localization in breast tumors, explaining their presence in secretomes and suggesting that tumor cells use unconventional secretion during tumorigenesis. The unconventional secretion of proteins into the extracellular space exposes a new layer of genome post-translational regulation and reveals an untapped source of potential tumor biomarkers and drug targets."

The results were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results of the microarray indicated that 138 genes were upregulated and 93 genes were downregulated in the CSCs. Certain genes that may be significant in the regulation of CSCs from the Du145 cell line were identified.

We present here the results from a proteomic analysis of microvesicles released to the extracellular environment by the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Using nanocapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 266 proteins were identified with two or more peptide sequences. Further analysis showed that 16% of the proteins were classified as extracellular and that intracellular proteins were annotated in a variety of locations. Concerning biological processes, the proteins found in PC-3 cell-released microvesicles are mainly involved in transport, cell organization and biogenesis, metabolic process, response to stimulus, and regulation of biological processes. Several of the proteins identified (tetraspanins, annexins, Rab proteins, integrins, heat shock proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, 14-3-3 proteins) have previously been found in microvesicles isolated from other sources. However, some of the proteins seem to be more specific to the vesicular population released by the metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cell line. Among these proteins are the tetraspanin protein CD151 and the glycoprotein CUB domain-containing protein 1. Interestingly, our results show these proteins are promising biomarkers for prostate cancer and therefore candidates for clinical validation studies in biological fluids."

        "title": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4-mediated 5-Fluorouracil resistance in a human colon cancer cell line.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the mainstay treatment for colorectal cancer for the past few decades. However, as with other cancers, development of 5-FU resistance has been a major obstacle in colorectal cancer chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to gain further understanding of the mechanisms underlying 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A 5-FU-resistant cell line was established from the human colon cancer cell line SNU-769A. Protein extracts from these two cell lines (parent and resistant) were analyzed using comparative proteomics to identify differentially expressed proteins. RESULTS: 5-FU-resistant human colon cancer cells were found to overexpress metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4). Other experiments showed cellular resistance to 5-FU (i.e., cell survival) was altered by the mGluR4 agonist l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP 4), and by the mGluR4 antagonist (S)-amino-2-methyl-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (MAP 4), in that L-AP 4 increased 5-FU resistance in SNU-769A cells, whereas MAP 4 ablated 5-FU resistance in 5-FU-resistant cells. However, there was no significant effect of L-AP 4 or MAP 4 on basal cAMP and thymidylate synthase levels. Interestingly, 5-FU down-regulated mGluR4 expression, and MAP 4 suppressed proliferation in both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: We here report mGluR4 expression in human colon cancer cell line, which provides further evidence for extra-central nervous system expression of glutamate receptors. Overexpression of mGluR4 may tentatively be responsible for 5-FU resistance and, although activation by agonist promotes cell survival in the presence of 5-FU, decreased mGluR4 expression or inactivation by antagonist contributes to cell death."

        "abstract": "Exosomes are secreted by all cell types and contain proteins and nucleic acids. Here, we report that breast cancer associated exosomes contain microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with the RISC-Loading Complex (RLC) and display cell-independent capacity to process precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into mature miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs, along with Dicer, AGO2, and TRBP, are present in exosomes of cancer cells. CD43 mediates the accumulation of Dicer specifically in cancer exosomes. Cancer exosomes mediate an efficient and rapid silencing of mRNAs to reprogram the target cell transcriptome. Exosomes derived from cells and sera of patients with breast cancer instigate nontumorigenic epithelial cells to form tumors in a Dicer-dependent manner. These findings offer opportunities for the development of exosomes based biomarkers and therapies."

        "abstract": "We investigated the cytotoxic effect of different sequential combinations of paclitaxel (Taxol, TX), an antimicrotuble agent, and methotrexate (MTX), a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, on a human bladder cancer cell line (T24). The results obtained with a colony-forming assay 5 days after 24 hr of exposure to TX alone showed a strong decline in colony growth up to a concentration of 6 nM. There was a plateau phase at TX concentrations ranging from 6 to 10 nM. The IC50 values found with the different dosing sequences and 24-hr exposure to the drugs were 0.24 microM for MTX alone, 3.49 nM for TX alone, 3.84 nM for TX followed by MTX, 3.75 nM for TX and MTX simultaneously, and 2.10 nM for MTX followed by TX. The cytotoxic effect due to drug interactions in the different sequential combinations was evaluated by an algebraic method. All the combination sequences were found to be synergistic (combination index [CI] < 1) at low TX concentrations. An antagonistic effect (CI > 1) was obtained at higher TX concentrations. Our data demonstrate that the T24 cell line is sensitive to TX and that the cytotoxic effect is enhanced to different degrees depending on the treatment sequence when TX is combined with MTX. These findings could have implications in the design of appropriate administration schedules of these two drugs for the treatment of bladder cancer."

        "abstract": "The major obstacle of treating cancer patients is acquisition of chemoresistance, in which treated tumor cells become insensitive after chronic drug exposure. To study the mechanism of acquired cisplatin resistance, we established a cisplatin-resistant human gastric cancer cell line. The cisplatin-resistant cell line (YCC-3/R) was isolated after exposing the gastric cancer cell line, YCC-3, to a constant concentration (0.5 microg/mL) of cisplatin for 12 months. The expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins (p53, Bax, p21, p27) in the YCC-3/R were investigated by western blot analysis. The cisplatin treatment significantly down-regulated the p53 and p21 expression level, while up-regulated the p27 expression in the YCC-3/R cells compared to the parental cells. The Bax expression level was similar in both cells. These results suggest that the p27 dependent-cell cycle arrest may prevent cisplatin-induced apoptosis and give enough time to repair the DNA damage in the YCC-3/R cells."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-214 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as the functional connection between miR-214 and PTEN in gastric cancer.\\n\\nMETHODS: miR-214 and PTEN expression was determined in gastric cancer and matched normal tissues, and human gastric cancer cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR. The roles of miR-214 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion were analyzed with anti-miR-214 transfected cells. In addition, the regulation of PTEN by miR-214 was evaluated by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assays.\\n\\nRESULTS: miR-214 was noted to be highly overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR. The expression level of miR-214 is significantly associated with clinical progression and poor prognosis according to the analysis of the clinicopathologic data. We also found that the miR-214 levels are inversely correlated with PTEN in tumor tissues. And PTEN expression level is also associated with metastasis and invasion of gastric cancer. In addition, knockdown of miR-214 could significantly inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that PTEN is regulated negatively by miR-214 through a miR-214 binding site within the 3'-UTR of PTEN at the posttranscriptional level in gastric cancer cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that miR-214 regulated the proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting PTEN post-transcriptionally in gastric cancer. It may be a novel potential therapeutic agent for gastric cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Compounds of plant origin and food components have attracted scientific attention for use as agents for cancer prevention and treatment. Wine contains polyphenols that were shown to have anti-cancer and other health benefits. The survival pathways of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), and the tumor suppressor p53 are key modulators of cancer cell growth and survival. In this study, we examined the effects of wine on proliferation and survival of human Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and its effects on signaling events.METHODS:Human NSCLC adenocarcinoma A549 and H1299 cells were used. Cell proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation. Clonogenic assays were used to assess cell survival. Immunoblotting was used to examine total and phosphorylated levels of Akt, Erk and p53.RESULTS:In A549 cells red wine inhibited cell proliferation and reduced clonogenic survival at doses as low as 0.02%. Red wine significantly reduced basal and EGF-stimulated Akt and Erk phosphorylation while it increased the levels of total and phosphorylated p53 (Ser15). Control experiments indicated that the anti-proliferative effects of wine were not mediated by the associated contents of ethanol or the polyphenol resveratrol and were independent of glucose transport into cancer cells. White wine also inhibited clonogenic survival, albeit at a higher doses (0.5-2%), and reduced Akt phosphorylation. The effects of both red and white wine on Akt phosphorylation were also verified in H1299 cells.CONCLUSIONS:Red wine inhibits proliferation of lung cancer cells and blocks clonogenic survival at low concentrations. This is associated with inhibition of basal and EGF-stimulated Akt and Erk signals and enhancement of total and phosphorylated levels of p53. White wine mediates similar effects albeit at higher concentrations. Our data suggest that wine may have considerable anti-tumour and chemoprevention properties in lung cancer and deserves further systematic investigation in animal models of lung cancer."

After SGC7901 cells were treated with DDP and/or chloroquine, cell proliferation was measured using MTT assay; cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry; autophagy and apotosis-related proteins expression were detected by Western blot; and quantitative analysis of autophagy after monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining was performed using fluorescence microscopy. We found after treatment with 5 mg/L DDP for 24 h, the rates of cell apoptosis were (21.07\u00b12.12)%. Autophagy, characterized by an increase in the number of autophagic vesicles and the level of LC3-II protein was observed in cells treated with DDP. After inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine, the rates of cell apoptosis were increased to (30.16\u00b13.54)%, and the level of Caspase-3 and P53 protein were increased, and Bcl-2 protein was decreased. Therefore, autophagy protects human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 against DDP-induced apoptosis, inhibition of autophagy can promote apoptosis, and combination therapy with DDP and chloroquine may be a promising therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer."

Bph caused the release of fluorescent protein from the mitochondria of MCF-7 cells transfected with the pDsRed2-Mito??-vector in a time-dependent manner, suggesting disruption of the mitochondrial membrane.

In the process of cell penetration, we observed that HOZOT cells adhered to target cells seemed to first insert their nuclei into the cytoplasm of target cells, distinct from the process of phagocytosis. In addition, blocking experiments showed that major histocompatibility complex class I is one of the target cell recognition molecules for HOZOT cells. Furthermore, we propose that cell-in-cell structures between HOZOT cells and target cancer cells could be one of the cytotoxic mechanisms of HOZOT cells."

However, SP method application has drawn special attention to the field of stem cell research, and the existence of SP cells in cell culture is being debated, most probably because different cell lines require different technical modifications, especially when cell staining is considered. In this study, the authors aimed to disclose whether the hoechst33342 staining required extensive optimization for identifying SP cells in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3. After systematic evaluations, it was found that only 2.5 microg/mL hoechst33342 staining of the cells for 60 min could get an ideal SP population, which accounted for 0.9% of the whole cell population. The sorted SP cells showed significantly higher colony formation efficiency than the non-side population (NSP) cells, and only the SP cells could form holoclones. Real-time PCR disclosed that SP cells expressed higher levels of \"stemness\" gene Oct3/4 than the NSP cells did, indicating that the SP cells might harbor cancer stem cells in this cell line. The results highlight the necessity of SP method optimization in cell studies, and the SP cells in this cell line merit further studies when cancer stem cell identification and isolation are considered."

In the present study, we report anti-proliferative activity of SRL and investigate underlying mechanisms of SRL-induced apoptosis, in the human ovarian cancer cell line PA-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS SRL-induced anti-proliferative effects were determined using MTT assay and induction of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. RESULTS SRL inhibited population growth of PA-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with maximum inhibition (71.3 \u00b1 1.9%) occurring at concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml after 72 h incubation. Observed effects of SRL could be blocked by competing glycoproteins, asialomucin, mucin and fetuin. Treatment with SRL resulted in increase in hypodiploid cell population as determine by cell cycle analysis. Increase in numbers of annexin V-PI positive cells, and cleavage of PARP confirmed apoptosis-inducing activity of SRL. Involvement of caspases in SRL-mediated apoptosis was determined by cleavage of caspases-3, -8 and -9 in a time-dependent manner, thereby suggesting possible involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase-dependent pathways. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity of SRL that can be exploited for potential application in ovarian cancer research."

        "abstract": "Evodiamine, isolated from a Chinese herbal drug named Wu-Chu-Yu, possesses many biological functions. Recently, it has been reported that Wu-Chu-Yu exerts an antiproliferative effect on several cancers. Prostate carcinoma initially occurs as an androgen-dependent tumor and is the second leading cause of cancer death in American males. In the present study, the effect of evodiamine on the growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP in vitro was examined. Based on [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yle)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay, evodiamine significantly inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells in a concentration-dependent manner. A significant and concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of evodiamine on LNCaP cell growth was observed at 24 hr and persisted for 96 hr. The examination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay showed that the cytotoxic effects of evodiamine on LNCaP cells were concentration dependent. Furthermore, we examined the influences of evodiamine on cell death and cell cycle. The flow cytometric analysis of evodiamine-treated cells indicated a block of G2/M phase and an elevated level of DNA fragmentation. The G2/M arrest reached a maximum at 24 hr after evodiamine treatment. The G2/M arrest was accompanied by an elevated p34(cdc2) kinase activity and an increase in the protein expression of cyclin B1 and phosphorylated form of p34(cdc2) (Thr 161). Examination of TUNEL showed that evodiamine-induced apoptosis was observed at 24 hr and extended for 72 hr. Evodiamine elevated caspase-3, and caspase-9 activities and the processing of caspase-3 and caspase-9. These results suggested that evodiamine inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, through an accumulation of cell cycle at G2/M phase and an induction of apoptosis."

        "abstract": "Objective: Growing evidence has shown that menthol has potent anticancer activity in various human cancers via the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)-dependent pathway or in a TRPM8-independent manner. However, its effect on bladder cancer remains obscure. In the present investigation, we examined the expression of TRPM8 and the role of menthol in cells of the human bladder cancer cell line T24. Methods: RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to confirm the expression and location of TRPM8 in T24 cells. Results: TRPM8 was highly expressed in T24 cells and located in both the cell membrane and cytoplasm. With the use of small interfering RNA to silence the expression of TRPM8, we found that menthol could increase the concentration of intracellular calcium and decrease cell viability via the TRPM8 channel in T24 cells. We also found that menthol could induce cell death through TRPM8 in T24 cells, rather than cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Moreover, the detection of mitochondrial membrane potential showed that menthol could induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization in T24 cells. Conclusions: In the present study, we demonstrated that menthol can induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization via the TRPM8 channel in cells of the human bladder cancer cell line T24, resulting in cell death. It would be helpful to explore the precise mechanism of action of menthol in bladder cancer with a view to its possible use as intravesical chemotherapy. \u00a9 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel."

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) in gastric carcinoma. A 5 fl uorouracil (5Fu)induced MDR gastric cancer cell line was selected and miRNA expression profiling of the cell line was conducted following exposure to 5Fu. The miRNA expression profiles between the parental and resistant gastric cancer cells were analyzed by Human miRNA OneArray(R) v3 and the results were confirmed by quantitative realtime RTPCR. The expression of 9 miRNAs (miR10b, 22, 31, 133b, 190, 501, 615, 5015p and 6155p) was upregulated while the expression of 18 additional miRNAs (miR32, 197, 210, 766, 1229, 1238, 3131, 3149, 12243p, 31623p, 532, 877, 47015p, 5096, 47283p, 1273d, 4863p and47633p) was downregulated in the SGC7901/5Fu cell line compared with its parental cell line. The results indicate that miRNA expression correlates with MDR in gastric cancer and may serve as biomolecular targets for MDR elimination."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2012, over 240,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and over 28,000 died from the disease. Animal models of prostate cancer are vital to understanding its pathogenesis and developing therapeutics. Canine models in particular are useful due to their similarities to late-stage, castration-resistant human disease with osteoblastic bone metastases. This study established and characterized a novel canine prostate cancer cell line that will contribute to the understanding of prostate cancer pathogenesis. METHODS: A novel cell line (Probasco) was derived from a mixed breed dog that had spontaneous prostate cancer. Cell proliferation and motility were analyzed in vitro. Tumor growth in vivo was studied by subcutaneous, intratibial, and intracardiac injection of Probasco cells into nude mice. Tumors were evaluated by bioluminescent imaging, Faxitron radiography, \u00b5CT, and histology. RT-PCR and genome-wide DNA copy number profiling were used to characterize the cell line. RESULTS: The Probasco cells grew in vitro (over 75 passages) and were tumorigenic in nude mice. Probasco cells expressed high levels of BMP2, CDH1, MYOF, FOLH1, RUNX2, and SMAD5 modest CXCL12, SLUG, and BMP, and no PTHrP mRNA. Following intracardiac injection, Probasco cells metastasized primarily to the appendicular skeleton, and both intratibial and intracardiac injections produced osteoblastic tumors in bone. Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated numerous DNA copy number aberrations throughout the genome, including large losses and gains in multiple chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: The Probasco prostate cancer cell line will be a valuable model to investigate the mechanisms of prostate cancer pathogenesis and osteoblastic bone metastases."

        "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be crucial for understanding the biological roots of cancer, and are of increasing importance as a target for new anticancer agents. According to an expression analysis of the cell surface antigens of various types of cancer, CD133 is considered to be a potential marker of cancer stemness. In this study, a human urinary bladder cancer cell line (J82) was used to analyze the cancer stem cell-like characteristics of CD133+ bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The CD133 expression in the J82 cells was examined and the cells were immunomagnetically categorized into positive and negative subsets. The CD133- and CD133+ subsets were phenotypically divergent with regard to the cell growth pattern, while CD133+ cells tended to colonize during their growth. In CD133+ cells, the pluripotent stem cell factors Oct-4 and Sox-2 were upregulated, and a statistically significant proliferation increase was observed when compared to CD133- cells. The CD133+ subpopulation was more tolerant to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an agent instilled intravesically to treat bladder cancer. In addition, CD133+ J82 cells were more resistant to radiation treatment when compared to CD133- cells. The in vivo tumorigenesis of the CD133- and CD133+ subsets of J82 cancer cells was also examined by subcutaneously injecting them into nude mice. The tumor growth was more aggressive in the CD133+ subpopulation, showing a significant difference in the tumorigenic potential in these subsets. In conclusion, J82 human bladder cancer cells include CD133- and CD133+ subpopulations, while the CD133 molecule is a potential marker of the potential malignancy of human bladder cancer. In the present study, the CD133+ subpopulation was herein demonstrated to have certain characteristics consistent with those of cancer stem cells."

        "abstract": "Recently a sub-population of cells with stem cell characteristics, reported to be associated with initiation, growth, spread and recurrence, has been identified in several solid tumors including oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). The aim of our pilot study was to isolate CD44+ cancer stem cells from primary cultures of OTSCC and neck node Level I (node-I) biopsies, grow cell spheres and observe their characteristics in primary cultures. Parallel cultures of hyperplastic lesions of tongue (non-cancer) were set up as a control. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect CD44/CD24 expression and magnetic activated cell sorting to isolate CD44+ cell populations followed by primary cell culturing. Both OTSCC and node-I biopsies produced floating spheres in suspension, however those grown in hyperplastic and node-I primary cultures did not exhibit self-renewal properties. Lymph node metastatic OTSCC, express higher CD44/CD24 levels, produce cancer cell spheres in larger number and rapidly (24 hours) compared to node negative OTSCC (1 week) and non-cancer specimens (3 weeks). In addition, metastatic OTSCC have the capacity for proliferation for up to three generations in primary culture. This in vitro system will be used to study cancer stem cell behavior, therapeutic drug screening and optimization of radiation dose for elimination of resistant cancer cells. \u00a9 2014 Saleem et al."

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports the existence of a subpopulation of cancer cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into diverse cell lineages. These cancer stem-like or cancer-initiating cells (CICs) also demonstrate resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy and may function as a primary source of cancer recurrence. We report here on the isolation and in vitro propagation of multicellular ovarian cancer spheroids from a well-established ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR-3). The spheroid-derived cells (SDCs) display self-renewal potential, the ability to produce differentiated progeny, and increased expression of genes previously associated with CICs. SDCs also demonstrate higher invasiveness, migration potential, and enhanced resistance to standard anticancer agents relative to parental OVCAR-3 cells. Furthermore, SDCs display up-regulation of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), anticancer drug resistance and/or decreased susceptibility to apoptosis, as well as, down-regulation of genes typically associated with the epithelial cell phenotype and pro-apoptotic genes. Pathway and biological process enrichment analyses indicate significant differences between the SDCs and precursor OVCAR-3 cells in TGF-beta-dependent induction of EMT, regulation of lipid metabolism, NOTCH and Hedgehog signaling. Collectively, our results indicate that these SDCs will be a useful model for the study of ovarian CICs and for the development of novel CIC-targeted therapies."

Extensive characterization of the cells was accomplished using androgen-dependent growth and sensitivity assays, Western analyses, RT-PCR/real-time PCR, cytogenetic analyses, and tumorigenicity in nude mice.\\n\\nRESULTS: E006AA cell line shows androgen-dependent growth, expresses PSA and the androgen receptor (AR) with 26 CAG repeats in exon 1 of AR. Cytogenetic analyses revealed a hypertriploid karyotype with additional numerical gains in chromosomes 5, 6, 8, 10, 17, 20, 21 and a marker chromosome of unknown origin as well as structural abnormalities in chromosomes 4, 5, 8, 9, 11-14, 18, and 20. This cell line is not tumorigenic in nude mice. S006AA cell line, isolated from the same tumor specimen, also expresses AR and shows the morphological characteristics of smooth muscle cells of prostatic stroma.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These cell lines are the first available primary epithelial and stromal cells derived from an African-American patient with organ-confined prostate cancer and in conjunction with other established cell lines, could provide an in vitro model system to investigate early transforming events in prostate cancer."

Human colon cancer cell line DLD-1 was treated for four days with 75 \u03bcmol/L genistein. Decreased nuclear \u03b2-catenin and increased phospho-\u03b2-catenin accumulation was detected, showing a change in WNT signaling. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed increased sFRP2 (a WNT pathway antagonist) mRNA expression following the genistein treatment. Methylation selective polymerase chain reaction showed decreased methylation in two CpG islands of the sFRP2 gene following genistein treatment, similar to the effect of 5-aza-cytidine, a demethylation agent.

However, few studies are carried out about expression and activation of classical MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) in human esophageal cancer cell line. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the expression and activation of ERK1/2 in human esophageal cancer cell line EC9706 and human normal esophageal epithelial cell line Heepic, which is as control. This study showed that ERK1/2 was transiently phosphorylated both in EC9706 and Heepic, the kinetics of which were slightly different. To further study the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in EC9706 and Heepic cell line, U0126 a kind of specific inhibitor of MEK was used. This study showed that U0126 can block the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a short time, the complete inhibition concentration for EC9706 and Heepic cell line is 50 and 20 \u03bcM, respectively. Incidentally, to further investigate the different roles of ERK1 and ERK2, vector-based short hairpin interference vectors targeted on ERK1/2 was constructed. Moreover, the effective interference target sequence was screened out in a transient transfection manner. MTT experiment showed that ERK2 is more important than ERK1 in the proliferation of EC9706 cells."

Tumor-bearing mice with gastric cancer cells were used to analyze the effects of RON\u0394160 overexpression and Compound I on implanted tumor growth.\\n\\nRESULTS: In vitro, overexpression of RON\u0394160 in MGC-803 cells resulted changes to their cell morphology, and promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, overexpression of RON\u0394160 increased the proportion of cells in the S phase. The effect of RON\u0394160 was significantly enhanced by induction of MSP inducing (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In vivo, RON\u0394160 promoted the growth of MGC-803 cells in nude mice, including increased tumor size and weight, and lower tumor incubation period. The Compound I inhibited the tumorigenic abilities of RON\u0394160 (p <0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that overexpression of the variant RON\u0394160 altered the phenotype and tumorigenicity of MGC-803 cells. Its specific small molecule inhibitor could inhibit the effect of RON\u0394160. Therefore, the variant RON\u0394160 may become a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Wnt family of secreted proteins is implicated in the regulation of cell fate during development, as well as in cell proliferation, morphology, and migration. Aberrant activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway leads to the development of several human cancers, including breast cancer. Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) antagonizes this pathway by competing with the Frizzled receptor for Wnt ligands resulting in an attenuation of the signal transduction cascade. Loss of SFRP1 expression is observed in breast cancer, along with several other cancers, and is associated with poor patient prognosis. However, it is not clear whether the loss of SFRP1 expression predisposes the mammary gland to tumorigenesis.\\n\\nRESULTS: When SFRP1 is knocked down in a non-malignant immortalized mammary epithelial cell line (76 N TERT), nuclear levels of beta-catenin rise and the Wnt pathway is stimulated. The SFRP1 knockdown cells exhibit increased expression of the pro-proliferative Cyclin D1 gene and increased cellular proliferation, undergo a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are resistant to anchorage-independent cell death, exhibit increased migration, are significantly more invasive, and exhibit a CD24low/CD44high cell surface marker expression pattern.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our study suggests that loss of SFRP1 allows non-malignant cells to acquire characteristics associated with breast cancer cells."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to overcome tumour cell resistance that generally develops after administration of commonly used anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin. METHODS: Recently, cell penetrating peptides have been used for their ability to deliver non-permeant compounds into cells. One such cell penetrating peptide, maurocalcine, has been isolated from the venom of a Tunisian scorpion. Herein, we report the effects of doxorubicin covalently coupled to an analogue of maurocalcine on drug-sensitive or drug-resistant cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB 231. RESULTS: We demonstrated the in vitro anti-tumoral efficacy of the doxorubicin maurocalcine conjugate. On a doxorubicin-sensitive cancer cell line, the maurocalcine-conjugated form appears slightly less efficient than doxorubicin itself. On the contrary, on a doxorubicin-resistant cancer cell line, doxorubicin coupling allows to overcome the drug resistance. This strategy can be generalized to other cell penetrating peptides since Tat and penetratin show similar effects. CONCLUSION: We conclude that coupling anti-tumoral drugs to cell penetrating peptides represent a valuable strategy to overcome drug resistance."

METHODS: Gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 was cultured to 80% fusion. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to quantify the influence of celecoxib in the proliferation, cell period, and apoptosis of gastric cancer cell line BGC-823. The expression of p21 and Fas by RT-PCR were investigated on gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 by the effect of different celecoxib concentrations. RESULTS: Growth of BGC-823 cells was inhibited by celecoxib in a dose-and time-dependent manner (P<0.05).Flow cytometry showed that celecoxib increased the proportion of cells in G1 phase, whereas decreased the proportion of cells in S phase and increased the apoptotic rates of cells in a concentration-dependent manner from 0 to 100 micromol/L in gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 (P<0.05). RT-PCR detection showed that the treated BGC-823 cells had increased the expression of p21 and Fas, which was also in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Celecoxib inhibited cell proliferation and apoptosis of human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823, which may be related to blocking the cell cycle progress by increasing the expression of p21 and inducing the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by increasing the expression of Fas."

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological and animal studies indicate that regular acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) intake is associated with a reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has also been shown to inhibit colorectal cancer cell proliferation in\u00a0vitro. The molecular basis for this specific cytotoxicity is an area of considerable debate. To investigate the toxicity of salicylates, the sensitivity of the DNA mismatch repair proficient SW480 human colorectal cancer cell line to four categories of compounds with varying degrees of structural similarity to acetylsalicylic acid was tested. These compounds were: i) salicylic acid analogues with substituents at the 5-position; ii) ASA analogues with extended chain lengths in the acyl group; iii) vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde; and iv) bis(2-carboxyphenyl) succinate (BCS) and structurally similar derivatives thereof. It was found that compounds with amino and acetamido substituents at the salicylate 5-position were less toxic than ASA itself. Modifications to the length of the hydrocarbon chain in the acyl groups of ASA analogues also marginally reduced toxicity. Vanillin exhibited relatively limited toxicity against the SW480 colorectal cancer cell line. Commercially available and in-house synthesised BCS (diaspirin) were notably more inhibitory to cell growth than ASA itself, yet retained substantial specificity against colorectal cancer cell lines vs. non-colorectal cancer cell lines. BCS and ASA were toxic to SW480 cells through initiation of necrotic and apoptotic pathways. Fumaroyldiaspirin and benzoylaspirin exhibited greater toxicity than ASA against the SW480 cell line. A novel method for synthesis of BCS, a compound that has erratic commercial availability, is described. We propose that the anti-inflammatory and anticancer capacity of BCS and the other analogues described herein is worthy of investigation."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of cultured cell lines as model systems for normal tissue is limited by the molecular alterations accompanying the immortalisation process, including changes in the mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) repertoire. Therefore, identification of cell lines with normal-like expression profiles is of paramount importance in studies of normal gene regulation. METHODS: The mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of several breast cell lines of cancerous or normal origin were measured using printed slide arrays, Luminex bead arrays, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the mRNA expression profiles of two breast cell lines are similar to that of normal breast tissue: HB4a, immortalised normal breast epithelium, and PMC42, a breast cancer cell line that retains progenitor pluripotency allowing in-culture differentiation to both secretory and myoepithelial fates. In contrast, only PMC42 exhibits a normal-like miRNA expression profile. We identified a group of miRNAs that are highly expressed in normal breast tissue and PMC42 but are lost in all other cancerous and normal-origin breast cell lines and observed a similar loss in immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines compared with healthy uncultured B cells. Moreover, like tumour suppressor genes, these miRNAs are lost in a variety of tumours. We show that the mechanism leading to the loss of these miRNAs in breast cancer cell lines has genomic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional components. CONCLUSION: We propose that, despite its neoplastic origin, PMC42 is an excellent molecular model for normal breast epithelium, providing a unique tool to study breast differentiation and the function of key miRNAs that are typically lost in cancer."

IGROV-1/APL resistant cell line shows the typical MDR phenotype: (1) increased expression of membrane-associated P-glycoprotein, (2) cross-resistance to drugs like etoposide, doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, colchicin and the novel anticancer drug Yondelis (ET-743). The Pgp inhibitor cyclosporin-A restored the sensitivity of IGROV-1/APL cells to Aplidin by increasing the drug intracellular concentration. The resistance to Aplidin was not due to the other proteins, such as LPR-1 and MRP-1, being expressed at the same level in resistant and parental cell line. The finding that cells over-expressing Pgp are resistant to Aplidin was confirmed in CEM/VLB 100 cells, that was found to be 5-fold resistant to Aplidin compared to the CEM parental cell line."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) promotes proliferation, survival, and differentiation of myeloid-linage leukemic cells, as well as normal hematopoietic cells. Terminal granulocytic differentiation can be induced in acute promyelocytic (APL) cell line HT93A by G-CSF and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Because the detailed mechanism has never been shown, we investigated the signal transduction pathway in granulocytic differentiation by G-CSF, alone or in combination with ATRA.\\n\\nMETHODS: HT93A cell viability and growth were investigated by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cell differentiation was assessed by CD11b and CD34 expressions. Intracellular protein expressions were also evaluated by flow cytometry after fixation and permeabilization.\\n\\nRESULTS: ATRA (100 nM) induced granulocytic differentiation (upregulation of CD11b and downregulation of CD34) and the effect was potentiated by addition of G-CSF, while G-CSF alone had no effect on HT93A cells. The addition of G-CSF to ATRA had little or no effect on NB4 and THP-1 cells in comparison to ATRA alone. G-CSF receptor expression was reduced by ATRA treatment in a time-dependent manner. After 5\u00a0days' incubation with ATRA, the expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, and phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5, were significantly reduced. STAT5 was strongly activated by G-CSF stimulation in ATRA-pretreated cells in comparison to untreated cells. In contrast, STAT3 showed no response to G-CSF. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib (320 nM) had little or no effect on ATRA-induced differentiation, but eliminated the enhancing effect of G-CSF, as evidenced by the levels of CD11b and CD34 expression. These results suggest G-CSF activates STAT5 through the JAK pathway in combination with ATRA, resulting in myeloid differentiation in HT93A cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is likely essential for inducting differentiation in the APL cell line HT93A; thus, monitoring its expression and activation is important for predicting clinical efficacy and understanding the mechanisms of cytokine-dependent myelopoiesis, proliferation, and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia."

In this study, we examined the expression of PMCA isoforms in the HT-29 colon cancer cell line using two methods of differentiation (sodium butyrate-mediated and spontaneous post-confluency induced differentiation). Our studies show that differentiation of HT-29 colon cancer cells is associated with the up-regulation of the PMCA isoform PMCA4 but no significant alteration in PMCA1.

This repair deficiency correlated with significant downregulation of the hOGG1 protein and the corresponding mRNA (30-fold lower than GAPDH) in BxPC-3 cell line. The repair defect was complemented in vivo by transient transfection of the hOGG1 gene and in vivo by recombinant hOGG1.

Although the classical mechanism of the action of estrogen involves binding to the estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2, and transduction of the signal into the cell, G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 30 has been shown to mediate nongenomic estrogen signaling. The goal of this study was to determine the role of GPR30 signal in the basic process such as invasion and carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer.\\n\\nMETHODS: We downregulated the expression of GPR30 in endometrial cancer cell line RL95-2 by transfection with shGPR30-pGFP-V-RS, a GPR30 antisense expression vector. The cells were then subjected to an MTT assay and a Transwell(\u00ae) migration assay. And an animal model was also used to investigate the influence of downregulation of GPR30 on oncogenesis.\\n\\nRESULTS: Downregulation of GPR30 led to reduced growth and invasion by cells treated with 17\u03b2-estradiol. And the capacity of transfected RL95-2 cells to promote tumorigenesis was weakened in vivo.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, for the endometrial cancer cell line RL95-2, GPR30 plays important roles in mediating the proliferative and invasive effects of estrogen and in tumorigenesis."

However, the identification of genome structural variations based on NGS approaches with read lengths of 35-300 bases remains a challenge. Single-molecule optical mapping technologies allow the analysis of DNA molecules of up to 2Mb and as such are suitable for the identification of large-scale genome structural variations, and for de novo genome assemblies when combined with short-read NGS data. Here we present optical mapping data for two human genomes: the HapMap cell line GM12878 and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116.FINDINGS:High molecular weight DNA was obtained by embedding GM12878 and HCT116 cells, respectively, in agarose plugs, followed by DNA extraction under mild conditions. Genomic DNA was digested with KpnI and 310,000 and 296,000 DNA molecules ([greater than or equal to]150kb and 10 restriction fragments), respectively, were analyzed per cell line using the Argus optical mapping system. Maps were aligned to the human reference by OPTIMA, a new glocal alignment method. Genome coverage of 6.8x and 5.7x was obtained, respectively; 2.9x and 1.7x more than the coverage obtained with previously available software.CONCLUSIONS:Optical mapping allows the resolution of large-scale structural variations of the genome, and the scaffold extension of NGS-based de novo assemblies. OPTIMA is an efficient new alignment method; our optical mapping data provide a resource for genome structure analyses of the human HapMap reference cell line GM12878, and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116."

Further increase of apoptosis was detected when HepG2 cells were co- treated with ABT373 and epirubicin. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that ABT373 or epirubicin ccould activate cell autophagy with elevated autophagosome formation, increased expression of autophagy related proteins and LC3 fluorescent puncta. CONCLUSIONS: ABT737 influences cancer cells through both apoptotic and autophagic mechanisms, and ABT737 may enhance the effects of epirubicin on HepG2 cells by activating autophagy and inducing apoptosis."

        "abstract": "Worldwide, cervical cancer (CC) is the third most common malignancy in women, and it remains a leading cause of cancer-related death of women. Genomic studies indicate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling is one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in several human cancers, including CC. This signaling pathway has an important role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility, and metabolism, and therefore could be an attractive therapeutic target. In a previous study, we used a sensitive and high-speed homogeneous assay for the detection of kinase activity and for screening of PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitors in a high-throughput screening (HTS) format and then obtain formononetin, as an O-methylated isoflavone existed in a number of plants and herbs like Astragalus membranaceus. We showed that formononetin inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and induced the apoptosis of CC cell line HeLa in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, formononetin suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Our results indicated that formononetin may be used as an anti-cancer drug for cervical cancer in the future."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, the theory of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has presented new targets and orientations for tumor therapy. The major difficulties in researching CSCs include their isolation and purification. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize the side population (SP) cells in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line H446, which lays the foundation for the isolation and purification of CSCs. METHODS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to sort SP and non-SP (NSP) cells from H446. Both subgroups were cultivated to survey the capacity to form into suspended tumor cell spheres. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the expression levels of the mRNA of CD133, ABCG2, and nucleostemin in both subgroups. The capacity of proliferation and the differences in drug resistance of both subgroups and unsorted cells were tested by the MTT method. The differentiation ability of both subgroups was determined by FACS. Proliferation was determined by subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice. RESULTS: The percent of Hoechst 33342 negative cells was about (5.1 +/- 0.2)% in H446 by fluorescence microscopy. The percent of SP cells was (6.3 +/- 0.1)% by flow cytometry. SP cells had a stronger capability of forming into tumor spheres than NSP cells. The mRNA expression levels of ABCG2, CD133, and nucleostemin in SP cells were 21.60 +/- 0.26, 7.10 +/- 0.14, and 1.02 +/- 0.08 folds higher than that in NSP cells (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P > 0.05, respectively). In vivo, SP cells showed better proliferative ability and tougher viability when treated with drugs. SP cells can differentiate into NSP cells, but NSP cells cannot differentiate into SP cells. SP cells had a greater ability to form tumors. CONCLUSION: The H446 cell line contained some SP cells with stem cell properties. CD133 and ABCG2 may be cancer stem cell markers of SCLC."

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis and function are under the control of 17??-estradiol, which acts through two distinct estrogen receptors (alpha or beta), and the estrogen receptors ratio can determine the final effect of 17??-estradiol on mitochondria. Our aim was to study the effects of 17??-estradiol on mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function in breast cancer cell lines with different estrogen receptors ratios. Mitochondrial biogenesis was increased in MDA-MB-231 (with only estrogen receptor beta expression), T47D (normal estrogen receptors ratio) and MCF-7 (highest estrogen receptors ratio) breast cancer cell lines, in response to different mitochondrial and cellular status. In fact, mitochondria of the MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell lines maintained their functionality, although, the MCF-7 cell line did suffer an important decrease in mitochondrial function. Thus, mitochondrial biogenesis increased in MCF-7 with the aim of mitigating these defective mitochondria. In normal conditions, mitophagic processes remove defective mitochondria to refresh the mitochondrial pool. Mitochondrial dynamics were also under control by 17??-estradiol, and showed modifications in the fusion/fission processes and the modulation of mitochondrial removal. In fact, cells with only estrogen receptor beta or with a low estrogen receptors ratio, such as MDA-MB-231 and T47D, showed an increase in fusion processes. However, the MCF-7 cell line, with more estrogen receptor alpha, also showed an increase in fusion processes, even though the fission processes were diminished and led to an accumulation of unfunctional mitochondria. Finally, the importance of estrogen receptor beta in mitochondrial biogenesis, function, as well as in mitochondrial dynamics was examined. Using the T47D-estrogen receptor beta tetracycline-inducible cell line, the results confirmed that when the overexpression of estrogen receptor beta was inhibited, there was an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, although these mitochondria were less functional, and with fewer fission events, although there was an increase in fusion processes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Loss of chromosome arm 18q is a common event in human pancreatic, colon, and breast cancers and is often interpreted as representing loss of one or more tumor-suppressor genes. In this article, we describe two novel biallelic deletions at chromosome band 18q21.1 in a recently characterized human breast cancer cell line, HCC-1428. One lesion deletes a fragment of approximately 300 kb between SMAD4 and DCC that encodes no known genes. The second lesion is an in-frame SMAD4 deletion (amino acids 49-51) that affects the level of SMAD4 protein but not the SMAD4 message. This change accelerates 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of both endogenous and exogenous mutant SMAD4. Examination of normal DNA from the same patient demonstrated that both lesions are somatic and associated with loss of both normal alleles. These data support the concept that two independent tumor-suppressor loci exist at chromosome segment 18q21.1, one at SMAD4 and the other potentially at an enhancer of DCC or an unrelated novel gene."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence has shown that menthol has potent anticancer activity in various human cancers via the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)-dependent pathway or in a TRPM8-independent manner. However, its effect on bladder cancer remains obscure. In the present investigation, we examined the expression of TRPM8 and the role of menthol in cells of the human bladder cancer cell line T24. METHODS: RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to confirm the expression and location of TRPM8 in T24 cells. RESULTS: TRPM8 was highly expressed in T24 cells and located in both the cell membrane and cytoplasm. With the use of small interfering RNA to silence the expression of TRPM8, we found that menthol could increase the concentration of intracellular calcium and decrease cell viability via the TRPM8 channel in T24 cells. We also found that menthol could induce cell death through TRPM8 in T24 cells, rather than cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Moreover, the detection of mitochondrial membrane potential showed that menthol could induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization in T24 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we demonstrated that menthol can induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization via the TRPM8 channel in cells of the human bladder cancer cell line T24, resulting in cell death. It would be helpful to explore the precise mechanism of action of menthol in bladder cancer with a view to its possible use as intravesical chemotherapy."

        "abstract": "Lipotropes, a methyl group containing nutrients, including choline, methionine, folic acid, and vitamin B(12), are essential nutrients for humans. They are important methyl donors that interact in the metabolism of one-carbon units and are essential for the synthesis and methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of excess lipotropes on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and normal mammary cells, MCF-10A, in culture. Both cell lines were grown in basal culture medium for 24 h and then switched to medium supplemented with 50 times the amount of each lipotrope as basal culture medium (control). Although there were no significant differences in growth between treatments in either cell line, gene array and Northern analysis revealed that expression of bcl-2 was decreased in lipotrope-treated MCF-7 cells. The ability to induce tumor cell death could have many uses in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Bcl-2 regulates apoptosis and has been shown to directly affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy agents, and it is suggested that strategies designed to block Bcl-2 might prove useful in sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. This study shows that although excess lipotropes do not inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, they can down-regulate the bcl-2 gene, suggesting that lipotropes may increase the susceptibility of breast cancer cells to anticancer drugs."

In this study, we have investigated the modulatory effect of a disintegrin, saxatilin, on the balance between MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in human ovarian cancer cell line MDAH 2774. Functional mechanism of the disintegrin-mediated transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 was examined in the ovarian cancer cell line. Saxatilin strongly induced TIMP-1 expression in dose- and time-dependent manners, while the disintegrin suppressed MMP-9 expression. Further analyses clearly indicated that interaction of the disintegrin and integrin alphavbeta3 results in the TIMP-1 promoter activation via c-fos to suppress TNF-alpha-induced cancer cell invasion. These results demonstrate that integrin alphavbeta3-mediated transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 is critical for suppressing the ovarian cancer cell invasion."

        "abstract": "Breast tumors are the second major cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. These tumors are aggressive, leading to metastatic cancers that are heterogeneous in nature, with numerous subtypes. The basal-like tumor subtype invariably shows unfavorable prognosis and is often characterized by the lack of estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors. These cancer types do not respond to the current targeted therapies. Therefore, the need for the discovery of novel diagnostic markers/therapeutic targets is of paramount importance. Immortalization of breast tumor cells leading to advanced stage cancer is one of the pivotal steps in breast cancer and telomeres/telomerase play a critical role in this process. Using single telomere length analysis, cell lines with a basal-like phenotype encompassing immortalized/non-tumorigenic MCF10A and invasive/metastatic MCF10CA1 along with the MCF-7 cell line were examined for the presence of a unique class of telomere t-stumps. Telomerase activity, protein levels of telomerase and bulk telomere lengths were assessed in the above-mentioned cell lines. This is the first study describing the existence of a distinct class of extremely short telomeres termed 't-stumps' in breast cancer cell lines. The cell lines MCF10A and MCF10CA1 showed distinct telomeric bands in the molecular size range of 100-1,000 bp, whereas the MCF-7 cell line showed very low levels of t-stumps. Of note is that only the highly invasive/metastatic cancer cell line MCF10CA1 exhibited an abundance of a cluster of t-stumps with a size distribution range of 500-700 bp. These unique t-stumps observed in the advanced breast cancer cell line may serve as a novel diagnostic marker and also form a key molecular target for novel anticancer therapy."

        "abstract": "The efficacy of adenovirus vector-based cancer gene therapy is controversial. Its uptake by cells in many cases requires the major receptor for adenoviruses, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Low transduction is believed to be one of the main barriers as the expression of CAR on tumor cells is frequently reduced. Increasing CAR expression on tumor cells thus offers a promising opportunity for more effective adenovirus based treatment. Expression of CAR in 62 cases of colon tumor specimens were examined with immunohistochemistry. To modify the CAR expression, the effects of proteasome inhibitor MG132 on CAR expression of colon cancer cell lines were determined by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and western blot. To evaluate adenovirus transfer, we further used rAd.EGFP, rAd.p53, and oncolytic adenovirus to infect target cells. The CAR expression was significantly decreased in colon carcinomas, both in primary tumors and lymphonode metastasis. Though the deregulation of CAR occurred in early disease and showed no relationship with TNM stage, when primary tumors are more than 5 cm in diameter, this deregulation becomes more frequent. More importantly, proteasome inhibitor MG-132 could enhance CAR expression in colon carcinoma cell line lovo, accompanied with enhanced adenovirus transfer, target gene expression, and oncolysis. These data provide a rational basis for evaluation of CAR expression in tumors and pretreatment with CAR conditioner prior to adenovirus vector-based gene therapy."

Garlic contains a complex mixture of oil and water-soluble organosulfur compounds. Diallyl disulfide (DADS), an oil-soluble constituent of garlic seems to be effective in reducing tumour cells originating from colon, lung and skin. Hence our present study focuses on the dose-dependent effect of DADS on an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line. Various concentrations of DADS ranging from 25 to 100 microM were given to LNCaP cells and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) and the level of prostate specific antigen were studied. DADS reduced the secretory activity of LNCaP cells with the gradual increase in dosage. DADS was found to act as a good antiproliferative agent, which was confirmed by proliferation assay. DADS also induced apoptosis and nuclear segmentation in the higher doses."

Ectopic expression of a partial sequence of PTX1 (Met84 - Leu225) as a VP22-fusion protein in prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, induced cellular senescence. Gene expression microarray analyses showed that interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and a number of IFN-inducible genes, among other genes, were upregulated by the PTX1-VP22 fusion protein. Upregulation of IFN-beta was confirmed by RTPCR and promoter-reporter assay. However, the upregulation of IFN-beta by the PTX1-VP22 fusion protein was not due to nuclear translocation of the PTX1 luminal domain."

TUNEL assays were also carried out to investigate pro-apoptotic properties as responsible for the effects of chokeberry extract.\\n\\nRESULTS: Chokeberry extract alone and its IC75 value (1 \u00b5g/mL) in combination with gemcitabine were used to assess the growth of the AsPC-1 cell line. Gemcitabine in combination with chokeberry extract was more effective than gemcitabine alone. TUNEL assays showed apoptosis to be a mechanism occurring at 1 \u00b5g/mL concentration of chokeberry, with apoptotic bodies detected by both colourimetric and fluorometric methods.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The implication of this study, using single cancer cell line, is that chemotherapy (at least with gemcitabine) might be usefully augmented with the use of micronutrients such as chokeberry extract."

        "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the lung neoplasia with the poorest prognosis, due to its high metastatic potential and chemoresistance upon relapse. Using the previously described mouse model for SCLC, we found that the tumors are often composed of phenotypically different cells with either a neuroendocrine or a mesenchymal marker profile. These cells had a common origin because they shared specific genomic aberrations. The transition from neuroendocrine to mesenchymal phenotype could be achieved by the ectopic expression of oncogenic Ras(V12). Crosstalk between mesenchymal and neuroendocrine cells strongly influenced their behavior. When engrafted as a mixed population, the mesenchymal cells endowed the neuroendocrine cells with metastatic capacity, illustrating the potential relevance of tumor cell heterogeneity in dictating tumor properties."

Lysosome-destabilizing experimental anticancer agent siramesine inhibits ASM by interfering with the binding of ASM to its essential lysosomal cofactor, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. Like siramesine, several clinically relevant ASM inhibitors trigger cancer-specific lysosomal cell death, reduce tumor growth invivo, and revert multidrug resistance. Their cancer selectivity is associated with transformation-associated reduction in ASM expression and subsequent failure to maintain sphingomyelin hydrolysis during drug exposure. Taken together, these data identify ASM as an attractive target for cancer therapy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

A human colon cancer cell line (S1) was treated with various doses of oxaliplatin, 5FU, radiation, and combinations thereof. Various clinically used schedules were mimicked. 5FU was either incubated during 1 h (\"bolus\") or 24 h (\"continuous infusion\"). When combining oxaliplatin and 5FU, an isobologram analysis revealed synergistic effects, regardless of 5FU schedule. The IC(10) and IC(50)-doses for the drugs where then combined with radiotherapy. With equitoxic drug doses (IC(50)), radiosensitization was observed in the following order: oxaliplatin > 5FU 24 h > 5FU 1 h exposure. The degree of potentiation corresponded to approximately 0.8 Gy, 0.7 Gy, and 0.2 Gy, respectively. In this experimental setting, oxaliplatin seemed to be a better radiosensitizer than 5FU, and longer incubation time with 5FU was better than short exposure."

        "abstract": "Polyamine analogue treatment results in growth inhibition and sometimes in cell death. Therefore, polyamine analogues are considered in the treatment of cancer; however, the cellular properties that govern sensitivity are not known. The objective of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms behind apoptosis induced by the polyamine analogue N, N-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM). Four different breast cancer cell lines were treated with DENSPM. Cell death was evaluated with flow cytometry and a caspase 3 assay. The levels of a number of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins in subcellular compartments were evaluated with western blot. In the most sensitive cell line, DENSPM treatment induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, resulting in activation of caspase 3 but without decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. However, in the three other cell lines DENSPM treatment did not induce extensive cell death. This is partly explained by the high levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bad and low levels of proapoptotic proteins Bax and procaspase 3 in these three cell lines. The results are also partly explained by the degree of activation of the catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine-N-acetyltransferase and polyamine pool reduction achieved by DENSPM treatment. Our results show that the protein profile of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins may contribute to the outcome to treatment with the polyamine analogue DENSPM. The results also indicate that it should be possible to find molecular markers for sensitivity to DENSPM that could be used in the clinic to predict sensitivity to a polyamine analogue."

Here we identify HOXA5 as an important repressor of intestinal stem cell fate in\u00a0vivo and identify a reciprocal feedback between HOXA5 and Wnt signaling. HOXA5 is suppressed by the Wnt pathway to maintain stemness and becomes active only outside the intestinal crypt where it inhibits Wnt signaling to enforce differentiation. In colon cancer, HOXA5 is downregulated, and its re-expression induces loss of the cancer stem cell phenotype, preventing tumor progression and metastasis. Tumor regression by HOXA5 induction can be triggered by retinoids, which represent tangible means to treat colon cancer by eliminating cancer stem cells."

To investigate the cellular origin(s) of this cancer, we assessed the effect of Trp53 and Rb1 inactivation in distinct cell types in the adult lung using adenoviral vectors that target Cre recombinase to Clara, neuroendocrine (NE), and alveolar type 2 (SPC-expressing) cells. Using these cell type-restricted Adeno-Cre viruses, we show that loss of Trp53 and Rb1 can efficiently transform NE and SPC-expressing cells leading to SCLC, albeit SPC-expressing cells at a lesser efficiency. In contrast, Clara cells were largely resistant to transformation. The results indicate that although NE cells serve as the predominant cell of origin of SCLC a subset of SPC-expressing cells are also endowed with this ability."

The metabolic activity was evaluated over the 24 hours. RESULTS: According to the statistical analysis, the change in the growth rate was significant (p<0.05) for the 120 nM docetaxel and above the 200 nM doxorubicin treatment in comparison with sensitive MCF-7 cells. When considering drugs in combination (60 nM docetaxel with 200 nM doxorubicin and 60 nM docetaxel with 500 nM doxorubicin) after the addition of 600 nM cyclophosphamide, we found a statistically significant decrease of metabolic activity of the MCF-7 cell line (p<0.05).

The aim of this research was to establish whether mifepristone is capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptotic cell death regardless of the degree of sensitivity ovarian cancer cells exhibit to cisplatin. METHODS: OV2008, OV2008/C13, A2780, A2780/CP70, Caov-3, and SK-OV-3 cell lines exhibiting a range of sensitivities to cisplatin were used. Growth inhibition, cell viability, and sub-diploid DNA content in response to treatment with escalating doses of either mifepristone or cisplatin were assessed by microcapillary cytometry. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by measuring genomic DNA fragmentation and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP). RESULTS: The sensitivities to cisplatin manifested by the cell lines were OV2008 > A2780 > Caov-3 > SK-OV-3 > OV2008/C13 > A2780/CP70. Mifepristone inhibited the growth of all six cell lines in a dose-related manner with IC50s ranging from ~6-12 muM and without significant correlation with the relative sensitivities the cells displayed for cisplatin. Moreover, at the highest concentration studied, mifepristone triggered apoptotic death in all six cell lines as evidenced by the increase in sub-diploid fragmented DNA content and cleavage of caspase-3 and of its downstream substrate PARP. CONCLUSION: Mifepristone is cytotoxic towards ovarian cancer cells independent of the sensitivity exhibited by the cells to cisplatin, displaying cytostatic effects at lower concentrations and lethal effects at higher concentrations. Mifepristone monotherapy emerges as a valuable therapeutic alternative for platinum-resistant ovarian cancers."

Cell morphology of GCSR1 in culture, maintained in vitro for over 90 passages, is similar to the cells from the patient. GCSR1 cells proliferated in vitro with a doubling time of 67.65 h. Karyotyping showed they were aneuploid. Missense mutation occurred in codon 193 of P53 and deletion occurred in exons 1 and 3 of P16. Results of CCK8 assay revealed that GCSR1 was more resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin (MMC) than other gastric cancer cell lines. Stem cell marker assay by flow cytometry showed that GCSR1 had high proportion of CD44+ and/or CD133+ cells. It formed colonies easily in soft agar and generated xenograft tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, GCSR1 is a well-established, well-characterized multi-drug resistant cell line with abundant cancer stem cells."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, and mutations in the BRCA1 gene produce increased susceptibility to these malignancies in certain families. In this study, the forward 1-13 exons of breast cancer associated gene BRCA1 were cloned from breast cancer cell line ZR-75-30 by RT-PCR method. Sequence analysis showed that nine BRCA1 splice forms were isolated and characterized, compared with wild-type BRCA1 gene, five splice forms of which were novel. These splice isoforms were produced from the molecular mechanism of 5' and 3' alternative splicing. All these splice forms deleting exon 11b and the locations of alternative splicing were focused on two parts:one was exons 2 and 3, and the other was exons 9 and 10. These splice forms accorded with GT-AG rule. Most these BRCA1 splice variants still kept the original reading frame. Western blot analysis indicated that some BRCA1 splice variants were expressed in ZR-75-30 cell line at the protein level. In addition, we confirmed the presence of these new transcripts of BRCA1 gene in MDA-MB-435S, K562, Hela, HLA, HIC, H9, Jurkat and human fetus samples by RT-PCR analysis. These results suggested that breast cancer associated gene BRCA1 may have unexpectedly a large number of splice variants. We hypothesized that alternative splicing of BRCA1 possibly plays a major role in the tumorigenesis of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Thus, the identification of cancer-specific splice forms will provide a novel source for the discovery of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and tumor antigens suitable as targets for therapeutic intervention."

Here we studied the effect of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7-laminin (LM) interaction on MMPs and the underlying signaling pathways. Culturing of MCF-7 cells on LM coated surface upregulated MMP-9 expression as well as reduced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) expression. LM induced MMP-9 expression is abrogated by the blockade of \u03b12 integrin. Inhibitor studies indicate possible involvement of phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) in LM induced signaling. LM treatment also enhanced phosphorylation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase), PI3K, ERK; nuclear translocation of ERK, pERK, NF-\u03baB and cell migration. Our findings indicate that, binding of MCF-7 cells to LM, possibly via \u03b12\u03b21 integrin, induces signaling involving FAK, PI3K, ERK, NF-\u03baB followed by upregulation of MMP-9 and cell migration."

In addition, antioxidant properties of the extract were evaluated by measuring its ability to scavenge free DPPH radicals. Moreover, the total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extract was determined based on Folin-Ciocalteu and colorimetric aluminum chloride methods.\\n\\nRESULTS: The findings of the study for the antiproliferative activity of the methanolic extract of M. persicum showed that growth of MCF-7 cells was inhibited by the extract in a dose and time dependent manner, where a gradual increase of cytotoxicity effect has been achieved setting out on 200 \u03bcg/mL concentration of the plant extract. The antioxidant assay revealed that the extract was a strong scavenger of DPPH radicals with an RC50 value of 52 \u03bcg/mL. The total phenolic and flavonoids content of the plant extract was 409.3 mg gallic acid equivalent and 168.9 mg quercetin equivalent per 100g of dry plant material.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Overall, M. persicum possesses potential antiproliferative and antioxidant activities on the malignant MCF-7 cell line that could be attributed to the high content of phenolics and flavonoids, and therefore warrants further exploration."

        "abstract": "One current challenge in the field of breast cancer infrared imaging is the identification of carcinoma cell subtypes in the tissue. Neither sequencing nor immunochemistry is currently able to provide a cell by cell thorough classification. The latter is needed to build accurate statistical models capable of recognizing the diversity of breast cancer cell lines that may be present in a tissue section. One possible approach for overcoming this problem is to obtain the IR spectral signature of well-characterized tumor cell lines in culture. Cultures in three-dimensional matrices appear to generate an environment that mimics better the in vivo environment. There are, at present, series of breast cancer cell lines that have been thoroughly characterized in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) cultures by full transcriptomics analyses. In this work, we describe the methods used to grow, to process, and to characterize a triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, in 3D laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) culture and compare it with traditional monolayer cultures and tissue sections. While unsupervised analyses did not completely separate spectra of cells grown in 2D from 3D lrECM cultures, a supervised statistical analysis resulted in an almost perfect separation. When IR spectral responses of epithelial tumor cells from clinical triple-negative breast carcinoma samples were added to these data, a principal component analysis indicated that they cluster closer to the spectra of 3D culture cells than to the spectra of cells grown on a flat plastic substrata. This result is encouraging because of correlating well-characterized cell line features with clinical biopsies."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a common disease with more than 1.6 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2008. Treatments for patients with advanced disease are rarely curative, and responses to therapy are often followed by relapse, which highlights the large unmet need for novel therapies. Recent advances in cancer treatment have focused on personalized therapy, whereby patients are treated with agents that best target the molecular drivers of their disease. Thus, a better understanding of the pathways that drive cancer or drug resistance is of critical importance. One such example is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is activated in many lung cancer patients and represents a target for therapy. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation has also been observed in tumors resistant to agents targeting upstream receptor tyrosine kinases. Agents that target this pathway have the potential to shut down survival pathways, and are being explored both in the setting of pathway-activating mutations and for their ability to restore sensitivity to upstream signaling targeted agents. Here, we examine the frequency of mutations activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, review the novel agents being explored to target this pathway, and explore the potential role of the inhibition of this pathway in the clinical development of these agents."

Many types of cell lines and tissues have demonstrated the presence of SP cells, including colon cancer cell lines. This study aimed to identify cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the SP of the colon cancer cell line SW480. SP cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by serum-free medium (SFM) culture. The self-renewal, differentiated progeny, clone formation, proliferation, invasion ability, cell cycle, chemosensitivity and tumorigenic properties in SP and non-SP (NSP) cells were investigated through in vitro culture and in vivo serial transplantation. The expression profiles of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein transporters and stem cell-related genes were examined by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The human colon cancer cell lines SW480, Lovo and HCT116 contain 1.1 \u00b1 0.10, 0.93 \u00b1 0.11 and 1.33 \u00b1 0.05% SP cells, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SP cells could differentiate into SP and NSP cells. SP cells had a higher proliferation potency and CFE than NSP cells. Compared to NSP cells, SP cells were also more resistant to CDDP and 5-FU, and were more invasive and displayed increased tumorigenic ability. Moreover, SP cells showed higher mRNA and protein expression of ABCG2, MDR1, OCT-4, NANOG, SOX-2, CD44 and CD133. SP cells isolated from human colon cancer cell lines harbor CSC properties that may be related to the invasive potential and therapeutic resistance of colon cancer."

This work sheds light on the system design aspects and key challenges that should be considered when experimentally analyzing and extracting the electrical characteristics of a tumor cell line. In this study, we developed a cellularbased functional microfabricated device using lithography technology. This device was used to investigate the electrochemical parameters of cultured cancer cells at the single-cell level. Using impedance spectroscopy analyses, we determined the average specific capacitance and resistance of the membrane of the cancer cell line B16-F10 to be 1.154 +/- 0.29 microF/cm(2), and 3.9 +/- 1.15 KOmega.cm(2) (mean +/- SEM, n =14 cells), respectively. The consistency of our findings via different trails manifests the legitimacy of our experimental procedure. Furthermore, the data were compared with a proposed constructed analytical-circuit model. The results of this work may greatly assist researchers in defining an optimal procedure while extracting electrical properties of cancer cells. Detecting electrical signals at the single cell level could lead to the development of novel approaches for analysis of malignant cells in human tissues and biopsies."

        "abstract": "Obtaining representative human colon cancer cell lines from fresh tumors is technically difficult. Using 32 tumor fragments from patients with colon cancer, the present study shows that prior xenograft leads to more efficient cell line establishment compared with direct establishment from fresh tumors (P < 0.05). From 26 tumor specimens, we successfully established 20 tumor xenografts in nude mice (77%); among 19 of these xenografts, 9 (47%) led to cell lines, including four from liver metastases. Only 3 of 31 tumor specimens (9.7%) grew immediately in vitro, and all were derived from primary tumors. To compare major phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of human colon cancer cell lines derived from the same tumor fragment using two protocols, the two pairs of cell lines obtained from 2 of 32 tumor fragments were extensively studied. They displayed similar morphology and were able to form compact spheroids. Chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, CPT11, and L-OHP differed between cell lines obtained from patient tumors and those derived from xenografts. Matched cell lines shared a common core of karyotype alterations and distinctive additional chromosomal aberrations. Expression levels of genes selected for their role in oncogenesis evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR were found to be statistically correlated whatever the in vitro culture model used. In conclusion, xenotransplantation in mice of tumor fragments before establishment of cell lines enables generation of more novel human cancer cell lines for investigation of colon cancer cell biology, opening up the opportunity of reproducing the diversity of this disease."

In the present study, the apoptotic effect of cordycepin on OEC-M1, a human oral squamous cancer cell line, was investigated by morphological observations, cell viability assay, annexin V-FITC analysis and flow cytometry methods. Results demonstrated that the number of rounded-up cell increased as treatment duration of cordycepin (100 microM) increased from 3 to 48 h, and the plasma membrane blebbing could be observed after 12 h treatment. In cell viability assay, cell surviving rate significantly decreased as the dosage and duration of cordycepin treatment increased (P < 0.05). Moreover, phosphatidylserine flipping on cell membrane could be detected with 3, 6 and 12 h cordycepin treatment, which indicated an early apoptotic phenomenon. Furthermore, cell cycle studies illustrated that the percentage of G1 phase cell declined as the dosages of cordycepin increased (10 microM to 5 mM), while the percentages of G2M and subG1 phase cell increased (P < 0.05) in 12, 24 and 48 h cordycepin treatment.

Here we show that elevated Aurora-A expression at levels that reflect cancer-associated gene amplification overrides the checkpoint mechanism that monitors mitotic spindle assembly, inducing resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (Taxol). Cells overexpressing Aurora-A inappropriately enter anaphase despite defective spindle formation, and the persistence of Mad2 at the kinetochores, marking continued activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Mitosis is subsequently arrested by failure to complete cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleation. This abnormality is relieved by an inhibitory mutant of BUB1, linking the mitotic abnormalities provoked by Aurora-A overexpression to spindle checkpoint activity. Consistent with this conclusion, elevated Aurora-A expression causes resistance to apoptosis induced by Taxol in a human cancer cell line."

In this study, we have investigated the modulatory effect of a disintegrin, saxatilin, on the balance between MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in human ovarian cancer cell line MDAH 2774. Functional mechanism of the disintegrin-mediated transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 was examined in the ovarian cancer cell line. Saxatilin strongly induced TIMP-1 expression in dose- and time-dependent manners, while the disintegrin suppressed MMP-9 expression. Further analyses clearly indicated that interaction of the disintegrin and integrin alphavbeta3 results in the TIMP-1 promoter activation via c-fos to suppress TNF-alpha-induced cancer cell invasion. These results demonstrate that integrin alphavbeta3-mediated transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 is critical for suppressing the ovarian cancer cell invasion."

        "abstract": "The effects of ligand activation of PPAR??/?? were examined in the mouse mammary tumor cell line (C20). Expression of PPAR??/?? was markedly lower in C20 cells as compared to the human non-tumorigenic mammary gland derived cell line (MCF10A) and mouse keratinocytes. Ligand activation of PPAR??/?? in C20 cells caused upregulation of the PPAR??/?? target gene angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4). Inhibition of C20 cell proliferation and clonogenicity was observed following treatment with GW0742 or GW501516, two highly specific PPAR??/?? ligands. In addition, an increase in apoptosis was observed in C20 cells cultured with 10 ??M GW501516 that preceded the observed inhibition of cell proliferation. Results from this study show that proliferation of the C20 mouse mammary gland cancer cell line is inhibited by ligand activation of PPAR??/?? due in part to increased apoptosis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

We investigated the contribution of this enzyme to the resealing of the injured plasma membrane in animal cells, using a lung cancer-derived cell line, A549. After mechanical injury by razor-scratching, the level of membrane resealing was estimated by differential incorporation of dextrans labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes. The recovery level was decreased in the presence of excess primary amine, as a competitive inhibitor of transglutaminase. We established a cell line that stably expresses shRNA (short hairpin RNA) to specifically inhibit the expression of TGase 2 (tissue-type isozyme of transglutaminase) and confirmed the suppressed resealing level in the cell. Furthermore, additional expression of TGase 2 rescued the ability for membrane resealing. These results show that, after mechanical damage, this enzyme appeared to contribute to membrane resealing. ?? 2008 International Federation for Cell Biology."

In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative effects of fresh American ginseng berry extract (AGBE) and its representative triterpenoid glycosides using the human colorectal cancer cell line SW480.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the contents of 8 ginsenosides in AGBE were determined. The cell growth inhibitory effects of AGBE and three triterpenoid glycosides (ginsenosides Rb3, Re, and Rg3) were evaluated by proliferation assay and (3)H-thymidine incorporation assay. Cell cycle and apoptotic effects were analyzed by using flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide and annexin V.\\n\\nRESULTS: HPLC analysis data showed that AGBE has a distinct ginsenoside profile. AGBE inhibited SW480 cell growth significantly in a time-dependent (24-96 hours) and concentration-dependent (0.1-1.0 mg/mL) manner. Ginsenosides Rb3, Re, and Rg3 also possess significant antiproliferative activities on SW480 cells. (3)H-thymidine incorporation assay indicated that AGBE and ginsenosides Rb3, Re, and Rg3 might inhibit the transferring and duplication of DNA in SW480 cells. Flow cytometric assay data suggested that AGBE arrested SW480 cells in S and G2/M phases, and significantly induced cell apoptosis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AGBE and ginsenosides Rb3, Re, and Rg3 possessed significant antiproliferative effects and induced changes of morphological appearance on SW480 cells. The mechanisms of the antiproliferation of AGBE and tested ginsenosides involved could be cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previously, we found that treatment of LM8 murine osteosarcoma cells with genistein, an isoflavone found in soy, increased the cellular level of \u03b2-catenin and decreased its invasive and motile potential. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the expression of \u03b2-catenin in LM8 cells is associated with metastatic potential in nude mice. To this end, we used untreated and genistein-treated LM8 cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: LM8 cells were treated for 3\u00a0days with or without 50\u00a0\u03bcM genistein and harvested by trypsinization. Untreated (the control group) and genistein-treated (the genistein group) cells were subcutaneously inoculated into the backs of male nude mice. After 25\u00a0days of inoculation, the tumors, lungs, and livers were excised, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. The sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lungs and livers were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) to confirm the absence or presence of metastatic tumors. The expression of \u03b2-catenin within the primary tumor was immunohistochemically examined.\\n\\nRESULTS: All mice in the control group (n\u2009=\u20098) exhibited large primary tumors, while in the genistein group (n\u2009=\u20098), one mouse showed no tumor formation and the remaining seven mice exhibited smaller primary tumors compared with the control group. The tumor mass of the genistein group was 23% of that of the control group. In the control group, multiple metastatic tumors were found in the lung and/or liver and the metastatic incidence was 100% in the lung and 87.5% in the liver. Six of seven tumor-bearing mice in the genistein group developed no metastatic tumors in the lung or liver, and this group was termed the genistein/metastasis(-) subgroup. Positive \u03b2-catenin immunostaining was observed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, and the \u03b2-catenin-labeling index was higher in the genistein/metastasis(-) subgroup than in the control group. The intensity of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin immunostaining was stronger in the genistein/metastasis(-) subgroup compared with the control group, and the \u03b2-catenin-labeling score was 1.9-times higher in the former subgroup than in the latter group.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin in LM8 cells causes inhibition of the growth of primary tumors and loss of the metastatic potential to the lung and liver."

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies. Established cancer cell lines are useful tools for clinical and basic researches. We have therefore established a new human ovarian cancer cell line, YDOV-151, derived from the mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and characterized it by the microarray analyses. A mucinous origin of the YDOV-151 was evident from light microscopy, and its epithelial-like character was confirmed with electron microscopy. No pathogenic mutations were found in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The subcutaneous transplantation of YDOV-151 cells into nude mice successfully induced the tumor mass after 3 weeks. cDNA microarray analysis revealed 1,926 genes (> 2-fold differences, P < 0.05) that distinguished the YDOV-151 from human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells. To identify candidate biomarkers, we selected five genes (SFN, RGC32, CDCA7, LAMP3, and SLCO4A1), each of which was up-regulated (> 7-fold) in YDOV-151 and had an available antibody assay for further validation. In SYBR Green real-time PCR, the relative expression levels of RGC32 (651-fold), LAMP3 (1,930-fold), and SLCO4A1 (20,598-fold) were significantly higher in YDOV-151 than in HOSEs (P < 0.001). RGC32 may be involved in cell cycle regulation, LAMP3 may promote metastasis, and SLCO4A1 is a member of anion-transporting polypeptides. The newly established ovarian cancer cell line, YDOV-151, would be a useful model for elucidating the biology and the pathogenesis of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. In addition, the identification and validation of up-regulated genes may provide a genetic approach for identifying biomarkers in ovarian cancer."

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of complement activation fragments.\\n\\nMETHODS: We assessed complement activation in four bronchial epithelial and seven lung cancer cell lines. C4d, a degradation product of complement activation, was determined in 90 primary lung tumors; bronchoalveolar lavage supernatants from patients with lung cancer (n = 50) and nonmalignant respiratory diseases (n = 22); and plasma samples from advanced (n = 50) and early lung cancer patients (n = 84) subjects with inflammatory lung diseases (n = 133), and asymptomatic individuals enrolled in a lung cancer computed tomography screening program (n = 190). Two-sided P values were calculated by Mann-Whitney U test.\\n\\nRESULTS: Lung cancer cells activated the classical complement pathway mediated by C1q binding that was inhibited by phosphomonoesters. Survival was decreased in patients with high C4d deposition in tumors (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18 to 7.91). C4d levels were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from lung cancer patients compared with patients with nonmalignant respiratory diseases (0.61 \u00b1 0.87 vs 0.16 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5g/mL; P < .001). C4d levels in plasma samples from lung cancer patients at both advanced and early stages were also increased compared with control subjects (4.13 \u00b1 2.02 vs 1.86 \u00b1 0.95 \u00b5g/mL, P < 0.001; 3.18 \u00b1 3.20 vs 1.13 \u00b1 0.69 \u00b5g/mL, P < .001, respectively). C4d plasma levels were associated with shorter survival in patients at advanced (HR = 1.59; 95% CI = 0.97 to 2.60) and early stages (HR = 5.57; 95% CI = 1.60 to 19.39). Plasma C4d levels were reduced after surgical removal of lung tumors (P < .001) and were associated with increased lung cancer risk in asymptomatic individuals with (n = 32) or without lung cancer (n = 158) (odds ratio = 4.38; 95% CI = 1.61 to 11.93).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Complement fragment C4d may serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer."

At concentrations ranging from 10 to 200\u2009\u03bcM, NH2 Cl (14-61% inhibition), but not hypochlorous acid, dose-dependently inhibited the cell viability of Caco-2 cells. Experiments utilizing methionine (a scavenger of NH2 Cl), taurine-chloramine and glutamine-chloramine revealed that only NH2 Cl affects the cancer cell proliferation among reactive chlorine species, with a relative specificity. Furthermore, flow-cytometry experiments showed that the anti-proliferative effect of NH2 Cl is partially attributable to both apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that NH2 Cl has the potential to suppress colorectal cancer cell proliferation. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This cell line was subjected to different concentrations of the above chemotherapeutic agents and zoledronic acid. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide) assay. Particularly, zoledronic acid in 100 micromolar (\u03bcM) concentration augmented the cytotoxicity by cisplatin 1 \u03bcg/ml from 25% to 70% (Z = 3.22, P = 0.0072). A significant portion of cells underwent apoptosis with or without zoledronic acid, but more so with the combination treatment as assessed by an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit. However, 100 \u03bcM zoledronic acid showed 50% cytotoxicity on its own, but failed to improve cytotoxicity by Gemcitabine. Thus, we show for the first time in a lung cancer cell line that zoledronic acid bears cytotoxic potential on its own and in conjunction with cisplatin. The clinical potential of this finding should be further studied. \u00a9 2007 International Federation for Cell Biology."

This study also reports that relative to suspensions of TAM with particle sizes greater than 6000 nm, nanoemulsions of TAM, having mean particle sizes of 47 nm, inhibited cell proliferation 20-fold greater and increased cell apoptosis 4-fold greater in the HTB-20 breast cancer cell line.

In vitro, inhibition of H1299 cell proliferation by irradiation was found to be irradiation dose dependent. The degree and duration of MDR inhibition in vitro in H1299 were also dose dependent. In the cells of both the C group and 3-Gy I group, no significant difference of MIBI accumulation was observed. In the 6-Gy I group, a higher MIBI accumulation was observed at only 7 days after irradiation relative to the C group. A higher MIBI accumulation in the 9- and 12-Gy I groups with a significant difference from the C group was observed at 4 to 14 days after irradiation. A significant negative correlation between intracellular MIBI accumulation and cell replication was found. In vivo, high accumulation and retention of doxorubicin were observed in irradiated tumors in the H1299 xenograft mice group at 4 to 14 days after 9-Gy irradiation compared with the control mice group. These results provide evidence for a synergistic effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Mol Cancer Ther; 13(11); 1-7. \u00a92014 AACR."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignancy of childhood. The scarcity of adequate cell models has limited our understanding of this tumor. Here we describe and characterize a new human liver tumor cell line, Hep293TT, derived from an aggressive childhood hepatoblastoma. PROCEDURES: Hep293TT cells were established using primary tumor tissues from a 5-year-old Caucasian female child. This cell line has been maintained for more than 34 months and over 20 subcultures, and was characterized by histopathology, ELISA, genotype, cytogenetics, CGH array, immunohistochemistry, and molecular sequence analyses. RESULTS: Cells were confirmed to originate from parental tumor cells, secrete alpha-fetoprotein, and express hepatic markers and beta-catenin. Hep293TT cells were able to form colonies in soft agar. Tumorigenicity was demonstrated by induction of solid tumors after subrenal capsule injection in immunodeficient mice. Hep293TT cells demonstrated a highly aneuploid karyotype, and a whole genome CGH analysis revealed chromosomal imbalances in every chromosome. Allelotype analysis demonstrated loss of alleles at distal 11p15.5 as is typical of embryonal tumors. Both Hep293TT cells and the primary tumor contain a deletion of 351 nucleotides in beta-catenin, as has been seen in other hepatoblastoma tumors. The cell line expressed beta-catenin protein in both full-length and partially deleted forms, and expressed NOTCH2 protein characteristic of hepatoblasts. No mutation was detected in the APC, MYH, MLH1, or MSH2 genes. CONCLUSION: This cell line, Hep293TT, is a valuable resource for the study of childhood liver cancer and may potentially provide a tool in the development of new agents."

The ability of clone formation was determined. It was observed and analysed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The growth of A549 and PLA 801D cell lines was evidently inhibited. Ability of clone formation was inhibited. The apoptosis index of cells was increased after treated with anticancer ketonon and the cell cycle was blocked at G0/G1 phase. CONCLUSIONS: Anticancer ketonon can significantly inhibit the growth of human lung cancer cells probably through inducing the apoptosis of cancer cells."

        "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality, and the identification of effective pharmacological strategies to target SCLC biology represents an urgent need. Using a high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we observe that SCLC is sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, in particular to THZ1, a recently identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7. We find that expression of super-enhancer-associated transcription factor genes, including MYC family proto-oncogenes and neuroendocrine lineage-specific factors, is highly vulnerability to THZ1 treatment. We propose that downregulation of these transcription factors contributes, in part, to SCLC sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors and that THZ1 represents a prototype drug for tailored SCLC therapy."

The bioactivity of 1 was found to differ markedly from that of ET-18-OCH3.

Compound 1 was cytotoxic to PC3 cells by caspasedependent apoptosis. The subcellular distribution of 1 differed from that reported for a phenyl-polyene analog of ET-18-OCH3; 1 was found to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosomes but not in the plasma membrane or nucleus of PC3 cells. However, no differences in accumulation of 1 were found between PC3 and cells that were not affected by the compound, implying that the selective PC3 cytotoxicity is a consequence of specific molecular components of PC3 cells."

        "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms associated with tumor metastasis remain poorly understood. Here we report that acquired expression of periostin by colon cancer cells greatly promoted metastatic development of colon tumors. Periostin is overexpressed in more than 80% of human colon cancers examined with highest expression in metastatic tumors. Periostin expression dramatically enhanced metastatic growth of colon cancer by both preventing stress-induced apoptosis in the cancer cells and augmenting endothelial cell survival to promote angiogenesis. At the molecular level, periostin activated the Akt/PKB signaling pathway through the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins to increase cellular survival. These data demonstrated that the survival-promoting function is crucial for periostin to promote tumor metastasis of colon cancer."

The mechanism is not entirely understood.\\n\\nMETHODS: To assess acquired resistance to CDDP, we established a CDDP-resistant subclone, CL8-2, of T24, which is a bladder cancer cell line. We examined the changes in the various pathways leading to apoptosis in the parent line and CL8-2.\\n\\nRESULTS: The drug caused apoptosis of T24 cells but not CL8-2 cells. The CL8-2 cells were 6.4 times more resistant to CDDP than was T24. In both cell lines, the mismatch repair genes hMLH-1 and hMSH-2 were expressed at high levels. The p53 protein was not detected in either cell line but p73 protein was induced by CDDP treatment in T24 cells, which was followed by activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9. This phenomenon was not observed in CL8-2 cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that loss of p73 induction may lead to CDDP resistance of TCC."

In the present study, we were interested in determining if flavonoid-induced genotoxicity may also provoke cancer cell death. Cyto- and genotoxicity of three selected flavonoid glycosides (naringin, diosmin and hesperidin) in DU145 prostate cancer cell line were investigated. Flavonoid glycosides decreased cancer cell number and proliferative activity in a different manner. Flavonoid glycosides induced oxidative stress: intracellular total ROS and superoxide production were augmented after flavonoid treatment. Flavonoid glycosides stimulated DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and micronuclei production. Diosmin was found the most potent genotoxic agent in DU145 cells, which, in turn, resulted in its pro-apoptotic activity. The more robust recruitment of 53BP1 was correlated with lower DNA and chromosomal damage after naringin and hesperidin treatment compared with diosmin treatment. Flavonoid glycosides were also found to be DNA hypomethylating agents with an ability to modulate cancer cell epigenome leading to changes in the gene expression patterns. Taken together, diosmin, a dietary flavonoid glycoside, was found active against DU145 cells by promoting genotoxic events and a concomitant apoptotic cell death. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of biological activity of diosmin against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo deserves further investigation."

We have previously shown that autophagy is controlled by two transduction pathways mediated by a heterotrimeric Gi3 protein and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities in the human colon cancer cell line HT-29. Here, we show that 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, increases the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to apoptosis induced by sulindac sulfide, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which inhibits the cyclooxygenases. Similarly, HT-29 cells overexpressing a GTPase-deficient mutant of the G(alpha i3) protein (Q204L), which have a low rate of autophagy, were more sensitive to sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis than parental HT-29 cells. In both cell populations we did not observe differences in the expression patterns of COX-2, Bcl-2, Bcl(XL), Bax, and Akt/PKB activity. However, the rate of cytochrome c release was higher in Q204L-overexpressing cells than in HT-29 cells. These results suggest that autophagy could retard apoptosis in colon cancer cells by sequestering mitochondrial death-promoting factors such as cytochrome c."

In human CRC specimens, CD133 and Notch intracellular domain-positive CRC cells colocalized in perivascular regions. An EC-derived, soluble form of Jagged-1, via ADAM17 proteolytic activity, led to Notch activation in CRC cells in a paracrine manner; these effects were blocked by immunodepletion of Jagged-1 in EC-conditioned medium or blockade of ADAM17 activity. Collectively, ECs play an active role in promoting Notch signaling and the CSC phenotype by secreting soluble Jagged-1."

To explore the pattern of APC methylation and the effect of APC gene methylation on its protein expression in lung cancer cell lines, we investigated APC promotor methylation by methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing and analyzed the APC protein levels by western blot in three lung cancer cell lines. Monoallelic methylation and 20 methylated CpGs in CpG island near the open reading frame (ORF) of the APC gene were found in the NCI-H460 cell line, and were stablely inherited within 10 generations of the cell line in culture. Our results showed that two special CpG sites (794, 797) might be binding sites for proteins that regulate APC expression. Protein expression of the APC gene in the NCI-H460 cell line declined, but was enhanced after the treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). Inherited monoallelic methylation of the APC gene may play an important role in lung cancer. Demethylation of the APC gene by 5-aza-dC may be useful for the treatment of lung cancer. ?? 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

Here we investigated whether one of homeobox-containing genes, Msx1, might be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle using Msx1 overexpressing human ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR3. Overexpression of Msx1 in OVCAR3 cells inhibited cell proliferation by markedly increasing the length of the G1 phase of the cell cycle over control cells. Consistent with this result, dramatic suppression of cyclins D1, D3, E, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, c-Jun, and Rb was observed. Elevated expression of genes involved in the growth arrest and apoptosis (GADD153 and apoptotic cystein protease MCH4) and suppression of proliferation associated protein gene (PAG) in Msx1-overexpressing cells by cDNA expression array analysis provide further evidence for a potential repressor function of Msx1 in cell cycle progression."

This study was to investigate biological effects of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD44L) on lung cancer cell line A549 (CD40 positive), and its possible mechanism. METHODS: A549 cells were co-incubated with sCD40L, cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay and 3H-TdR incorporation method. Immunofluorescence technique and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to evaluate changes in cell phenotypes and cell cycle. Cell apoptosis, and expression changes of Bcl-2 and Bax were observed by FCM, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with control cells, proliferation of A549 cells co-incubated with sCD40L was inhibited (P< 0.05). Positive rates of cell surface molecules, CD49e, CD54, TNFRI, and CD95L, in A549 cells co-incubated with sCD40L for 72 h were (61.2+/-4.8)%, (31.2+/-6.1)%,(42.7+/-5.9)%, and (38.2+/-3.4)%, respectively, while those in control cells were (34.7+/-2.1)%, (7.1+/-1.6)%, (15.2+/-4.1)%, and (10.1+/-2.3)%, respectively (P< 0.05). However, positive rate of TNFRII in A549 cells co-incubated with sCD40L[(8.7+/-0.8)%] was lower than that in control cells [(58.1+/-3.6)%] (P< 0.05). G1 phase of A549 cells treated with sCD40L for 72 h was (76.0+/-9.1)%, more than that of control cells [(56.7+/-6.9)%], while S phase of sCD40L-treated A549 cells [(10.3+/-5.7)%] was less than that of control cells [(32.7+/-5.5)%]. No significant apoptosis of A549 cells was observed after co-incubated with sCD40L for 72 h, but Bax expression was up-regulated. CONCLUSION: sCD40L may inhibit cell proliferation, cause changes in phenotype and cell cycle of A549 cells, and alter expression of apoptosis-associated gene, such as Bax."

        "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in identifying potent cancer-preventive and therapeutic agents against breast cancer. A great number of reports have in recent years dealt with anticancer characteristics of Semecarpus anacardium nut extract (SA). The majority of these studies has been targeted on the protective effect rendered to the living system rather than the preventive effect on cancer cells. SA was tested for its inhibitory effect on human breast cancer cells (T47D). Cytotoxicity analyses suggested that these cells had become apoptotic. SA was discovered to induce rapid Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores of T47D cell line, and its cytotoxicity against T47D was well correlated with altered mitochondrial transmembrane potential. At the molecular level, these changes are accompanied by decrease in bcl2 and increase in bax, cytochrome c, caspases and PARP cleavage, and ultimately by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Taken together, our results provide unprecedented evidence that SA triggers apoptotic signals in T47D cells. ?? 2007."

        "abstract": "Paclitaxel is a mainstay of treatment for many solid tumors, and frequently, clinical outcome is influenced by paclitaxel sensitivity. Despite this, our understanding of the molecular basis of paclitaxel response is incomplete. Recently, it has been shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) influence messenger RNA (mRNA) transcriptional control and can contribute to human carcinogenesis. In the present study, our objective was to identify miRNAs associated with cancer cell line response to paclitaxel and to evaluate these miRNAs as therapeutic targets to increase paclitaxel sensitivity. We measured the expression of 335 unique miRNAs in 40 human cancer cell lines selected from the NCI panel. We then integrated miRNA expression data with publicly available paclitaxel-sensitivity (GI\u2085\u2080) data for each of the 40 cell lines to identify miRNAs associated with paclitaxel sensitivity. Ovarian cancer cell lines with differential miRNA expression and paclitaxel sensitivity were transiently transfected with miRNA precursors and inhibitors, and the effects on in vitro cell paclitaxel sensitivity were evaluated. Pearson's correlation identified 2 miRNAs (miR-367 and miR-30a-5p) associated with the NCI40 cell line in vitro paclitaxel response (P<0.0003). Ovarian cancer cells were selected based on the association between paclitaxel sensitivity and miR-367/miR-30a-5p expression. Overexpression of miR-367 in the paclitaxel-sensitive cells [PA1; IC\u2085\u2080, 1.69 nM, high miR-367 (2.997), low miR-30a-5p (-0.323)] further increased paclitaxel sensitivity, whereas miR-367 depletion decreased paclitaxel sensitivity. In contrast, overexpression and depletion of miR-30a-5p in the paclitaxel-resistant cells [OVCAR4; IC\u2085\u2080, 17.8 nM, low miR-367 (-0.640), high miR-30a-5p (3.270)] decreased and increased paclitaxel sensitivity, respectively. We identified and successfully targeted miRNAs associated with human cancer cell line response to paclitaxel. Our strategy of integrating in vitro miRNA expression and drug sensitivity data may not only aid in the characterization of determinants of drug response but also in the identification of novel therapeutic targets to increase activity of existing therapeutics."

METHODS: Four-pairs of small interfering RNA sequences of BCSG1 were chemically synthesized and inserted into the plasmid expression vectors, and were then transfected into human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 by liposome method. Plasmid vector with unrelated sequence was used as the vector control. Cells transfected with 4 siRNA sequences, control vector and naive FCF7 cells were transplanted into the nude mice. The tumor inhibition was analysised. Immunohistochemical SP method and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were adopted to detect the BCSG1 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Breast tissue samples of human infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ductal hyperplasia and fibroadenoma were also used as the controls. RESULTS: The inhibition rates of tumor growth in four BCSG1-siRNA transfected groups were remarkably higher than those of the vector control group and naive MCF7 cells (P<0.01). Compared with that of the vector control and naive MCF7 cell group, there was a significant decrease of BCSG-1 protein expression in the four experimental groups by immuno-histochemistry staining (P<0.01). In addition, BCSG1 mRNA expression in the four groups transfected with BCSG1-siRNA were significantly less than that of the control vector group, naive MCF7 cell control group and human breast IDC (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: BCSG1-siRNA down-regulates the expression of BCSG1 and inhibits effectively growth of the transplaned human breast cancer cell line in nude mice."

We tested the therapeutic potential of metabolic drugs in NSCLC and identified phenformin, a mitochondrial inhibitor and analog of the diabetes therapeutic metformin, as selectively inducing apoptosis in LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells. Therapeutic trials in Kras-dependent mouse models of NSCLC revealed that tumors with Kras and Lkb1 mutations, but not those with Kras and p53 mutations, showed selective response to phenformin as a single agent, resulting in prolonged survival.

        "abstract": "Cisplatin is a key drug in chemotherapy for lung cancer. It has been reported that intracellular accumulation of cisplatin is an important step as a determinant for resistance to cisplatin, which may be modulated by Na+, K+-ATPase activity. And it has been reported that isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, enhances sensitivity to cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In this study, the effects of the selective beta1, beta2, and beta3-adrenoceptor agonists on membrane Na+, K+-ATPase activity and sensitivity to cisplatin were evaluated using human non-small cell lung cancer cell line. In the NSCLC cell line, sensitivity to cisplatin was improved by treatment with procaterol, a selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist. Na+, K+-ATPase was activated and intracellular accumulation of cisplatin increased with the treatment. However, beta1 or beta3-adrenoceptor agonist did not modulate sensitivity to cisplatin or Na+, K+-ATPase activity. These results suggest that beta2-adrenoceptor may be one of the determinants for sensitivity to cisplatin in NSCLC. Exogenous beta2-adrenoceptor agonists may improve the antitumor effect of chemotherapy involving cisplatin."

Yet, little has been done to characterize how closely Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) cell lines model native tumors. To determine their similarity to MCC tumor samples, we characterized MCC cell lines via gene expression microarrays. Using whole transcriptome gene expression signatures and a computational bioinformatic approach, we identified significant differences between variant cell lines (UISO, MCC13, and MCC26) and fresh frozen MCC tumors. Conversely, the classic WaGa and Mkl-1 cell lines more closely represented the global transcriptome of MCC tumors. When compared to publicly available cancer lines, WaGa and Mkl-1 cells were similar to other neuroendocrine tumors, but the variant cell lines were not. WaGa and Mkl-1 cells grown as xenografts in mice had histological and immunophenotypical features consistent with MCC, while UISO xenograft tumors were atypical for MCC. Spectral karyotyping and short tandem repeat analysis of the UISO cells matched the original cell line's description, ruling out contamination. Our results validate the use of transcriptome analysis to assess the cancer cell line representativeness and indicate that UISO, MCC13, and MCC26 cell lines are not representative of MCC tumors, whereas WaGa and Mkl-1 more closely model MCC.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 18 December 2014. doi:10.1038/jid.2014.518."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the combined antineoplastic effect of the DNA methylation inhibitor hydralazine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid in a panel of cancer cell lines. RESULTS: Hydralazine showed no growth inhibitory effect on cervical, colon, breast, sarcoma, glioma, and head & neck cancer cell lines when used alone. On the contrary, valproic acid showed a strong growth inhibitory effect that is potentiated by hydralazine in some cell lines. Individually, hydralazine and valproic acid displayed distinctive effects upon global gene over-expression but the number of genes over-expressed increased when cells were treated with the combination. Treatment of HeLa cells with hydralazine and valproic acid lead to an increase in the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine, cisplatin and adriamycin. A higher antitumor effect of adriamycin was observed in mice xenografted with human fibrosarcoma cells when the animals were co-treated with hydralazine and valproic acid. CONCLUSION: Hydralazine and valproic acid, two widely used drugs for cardiovascular and neurological conditions respectively have promising antineoplastic effects when used concurrently and may increase the antitumor efficacy of current cytotoxic agents."

Caspase-3 has been shown to be activated which finally leads to the death of HepG2 cell (apoptosis). GC-MS analysis showed that the highest percentage of compound identified in the extract of G. dulcis flesh was hydroxymethylfurfural and 3-methyl-2,5-furandione, together with xanthones and flavonoids (based on literature), could synergistically contribute to the observed effects. This finding suggested that the flesh extract of G. dulcis has its own potential as cancer chemotherapeutic agent against liver cancer cell."

        "abstract": "Progesterone in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) preparations increases, while hysterectomy greatly reduces, the incidence of breast cancer. Cross-talk between the progesterone and growth factor signaling pathways occurs at multiple levels and this maybe a key factor in breast cancer survival and progression. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the effect of progesterone pre-treatment on the sensitization of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathway to EGF in the breast cancer cell line ZR-75. For the first time in ZR-75 cells and in agreement with previous work using synthetic progestins, we demonstrate that pre-treatment with the natural ligand progesterone increases EGF receptor (EGFR) levels and subsequent ligand-dependent phosphorylation. Downstream we demonstrate that progesterone alone increases erk-1 + 2 phosphorylation, potentiates EGF-phosphorylated erk-1 + 2 and maintains these levels elevated for 24 h; over 20 h longer than in vehicle treated cells. Additionally, progesterone increased the levels of STAT5, another component of the EGF signaling cascade. Progesterone increased EGF mediated transcription of a c-fos promoter reporter and the nuclear localization of the native c-fos protein. Furthermore, progesterone and EGF both alone and in combination, significantly increase cell proliferation. Several results presented herein demonstrate the conformity between the action of the natural ligand progesterone with that of synthetic progestins such as MPA and R5020 and allows the postulation that the progestin/progesterone-dependent increase of EGF signaling provides a survival advantage to burgeoning cancer cells and may contribute to the breast cancer risk associated with endogenous progesterone and with progestin-containing HRT."

We compared the estrogenic potency of TeBBPA, BPA and the brominated analogs mono- (MBBPA), di- (DBBPA), and tribromobisphenol A (TrBBPA) in the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. All of the compounds competed with 17beta-estradiol for binding to the estrogen receptor, although the affinity of the test chemicals to the estrogen receptor was much lower than that of 17beta-estradiol. TrBBPA and TeBBPA showed a considerably lower access to the estrogen receptors within intact MCF-7 cells incubated in 100% serum compared to incubation in serum-free medium, indicating a strong binding to serum proteins. BPA, MBBPA, and DBBPA showed only a slightly reduced access to the receptors. All of the test compounds induced proliferation in MCF-7 cells, the potential decreasing with increasing number of bromo-substitutions. TeBBPA did not induce maximal cell growth, indicating cytotoxic effects at high concentrations. BPA and the brominated analogs, except TeBBPA, induced progesterone receptor and pS2 to the same extent as 17beta-estradiol, although at much higher concentrations. Our studies demonstrate that compared to 17beta-estradiol, BPA and the brominated analogs have much lower estrogenic potencies for all of the endpoints tested, TeBBPA being the least estrogenic compound."

The actions of androgens are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), a transcription factor member of the super-family of nuclear hormone receptors.

In the present study, we used DDRT-PCR (differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) technique in order to investigate differentially expressed genes in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP after treatment with dihydrotestosterone and bicalutamide for 6, 24, and 48 hours. Fifty-five differentially expressed fragments were isolated, cloned, and sequenced. Sequencing analysis of these fragments revealed 56 different transcripts that showed homology to transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, metabolic enzymes, and hypothetical proteins. Among the differentially expressed genes, SPA17 and DDEF2 were further validated using quantitative real time RT-PCR (qPCR) in a series of 25 prostate tumor samples. The DDEF2 gene is involved in adhesion and cell migration of monocytes, and the SPA17 gene might be involved in cellular signal transduction. The transcripts of both, SPA17 and DDEF2 genes, showed altered pattern of expression in the group of prostate tumors analyzed by qPCR. The differentially expressed genes identified in this study might provide new insights into the androgen signaling pathways in prostate cells. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

However, there has been no direct observation of the properties of gastric CSCs in vitro. Here we describe a vincristine (VCR)-preconditioning approach to obtain cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. The CSLCs displayed mesenchymal characteristics, including the up-regulated mesenchymal markers Snail, Twist, and vimentin, and the down-regulated epithelial marker E-cadherin. Using a Matrigel-based differentiation assay, CSLCs formed 2D tube-like and 3D complex lumen-like structures, which resembled differentiated gastric crypts. The characteristic of cellular differentiation was also found by transmission electron microscopy and up-regulation of gastrointestinal genes CDX2 and SOX2. We further showed that CSLCs could self-renew through significant asymmetric division compared with parent cells by tracing PKH-26, BrdU, and EDU label-retaining cells. In addition, these CSLCs also increased expression of CD44, CD90, and CXCR4 at the mRNA level, which was identified as novel targets. Furthermore, drug sensitivity assays and xenograft experiments demonstrated that the cells developed multi-drug resistance (MDR) and significant tumorigenicity in vivo. In summary, gastric CSCs were identified from VCR-preconditioned SGC7901 cell line, characterized by high tumorigenicity and the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation."

It is clear that new comparative approaches to study cancer etiology are likely to be productive.\\n\\nRESULTS: A continuous line of breast carcinoma cells (WalBC) was established from a primary breast cancer that spontaneously arose in a female tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). The primary tumor was 1.5 cm3 and although large, did not appear to invade the stroma and lacked vimentin expression. The WalBC cell line was cultured from the primary tumor and passaged for 22 months. WalBC cells displayed an epithelial morphology when grown on plastic, were not EGF responsive, stained strongly for cyto-keratin and negatively for vimentin. WalBC cells were shown to be non-invasive within a Matrigel invasion assay and failed to produce tumors following transplantation into nude mice. Gene expression profiling of WalBC cells was performed using a cDNA microarray of nearly 10,000 mammary gland cDNA clones and compared to normal primary mammary cells and profiles of human breast cancer. Seventy-six genes were down-regulated and sixty-six genes were up-regulated in WalBC cells when compared to primary mammary cells. WalBC cells exhibited expression of known markers of basal invasive human breast cancers as well as increased KRT17, KRT 14 and KRT 19, DSP, s100A4, NDRG-1, ANXA1, TK1 and AQP3 gene expression and decreased gene expression of TIMP3, VIM and TAGLN. New targets for breast cancer treatment were identified such as ZONAB, PACSIN3, MRP8 and SUMO1 which have human homologues.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates how novel models of breast cancer can provide new fundamental clues regarding cancer etiology which may lead to new human treatments and therapies."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a model of cell cycle progression and apply it to cells of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We consider cells existing in the three typical cell cycle phases determined using flow cytometry: the G1, S, and G2/M phases. We further break each phase up into model phases in order to capture certain features such as cells remaining in phases for a minimum amount of time. The model is also able to capture the environmentally responsive part of the G1 phase, allowing for quantification of the number of environmentally responsive cells at each point in time. The model parameters are carefully chosen using data from various sources in the biological literature. The model is then validated against a variety of experiments, and the excellent fit with experimental results allows for insight into the mechanisms that influence observed biological phenomena. In particular, the model is used to question the common assumption that a 'slow cycling population' is necessary to explain some results. Finally, an extension is proposed, where cell death is included in order to accurately model the effects of tamoxifen, a common first line anticancer drug in breast cancer patients. We conclude that the model has strong potential to be used as an aid in future experiments to gain further insight into cell cycle progression and cell death."

In this study, we characterized drug resistant breast cancer cell line-MCF-7/Adr and a number of breast cancer cell lines using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, mammosphere formation assay and migration assay, examining their CSC immunophenotypes, presence of CSC proteins, tumorigenicity in vitro and migratory rates, respectively. Our results show that MCF-7/Adr cells uniformly display CSC characteristics yet retain low migratory rate. They are also able to self-renew and differentiate under floating culture conditions. Furthermore, MCF-7/Adr is selectively sensitive to epigenetic drug, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), losing drug resistance and changes morphology yet retaining CSC immunophenotypes. In conclusion, we show that resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7/Adr demonstrates uniform CSC like characteristics and are sensitive to epigenetic drug treatment."

        "abstract": "The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens."

However, elucidating the roles of miRNAs in cancer biology, especially in epithelial cancers, remains an ongoing process. In this study, we identified the differentially expressed miR-645 in the progressing of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and investigated its biological function.\\n\\nMETHODS: The association between clinicopathological parameters and the expression levels of the candidated miRNAs were analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The cell growth, invasion and migration potential, and clone formation were observed to detect the functions of the miRNAs in HNSCC cells.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the 34 HNSCC tissues with lymph node metastasis, the expression level of miR-645 was 0.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, and the expression level was 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 in the 28 tissues with non lymph node metastasis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). In patients with HNSCC, higher level of miR-645 expression significantly correlates with worse overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Ectopic expression of miR-645 promoted cell invasion and migration.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: miR-645 play a key role in cell invasion and metastasis and their expression correlates with overall survival in the patients with HNSCC."

        "abstract": "Common fragile sites are non-randomly distributed unstable chromosomal regions thought to be hot spots for recombination. They appear as gaps, breaks and triradial figures when cells are cultured under conditions that inhibit replication or repair of DNA. The removal of replication-inhibitory challenges is followed by repair activation to restore the DNA damage at the fragile site. The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436 has a spontaneous and non-random expression pattern of fragile sites that appear to be related to the complex pattern of chromosomal rearrangements. The high frequency of which fragile sites are spontaneously activated should make MDA-MB-436 cells a powerful tool to study in greater detail the DNA sequences of a multiplicity of fragile sites. Here, we have explored if the DNA at spontaneously activated fragile sites in MDA-MB-436 cells can be genetically tagged by the repair-mediated insertion of an exogenously supplied drug resistance gene. The cells were transfected with pSV2Neo, stably transfected clones were selected with neomycin, and the sites of pSV2Neo integration were determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Eighty-eight of 100 isolated clones had a non-random distribution of a total of 112 pSV2Neo integrations. Of these, 95 integrations (85%) coincide with the position at which non-random gaps and breaks appear in the MDA-MB-436 cells. Forty-nine (44%) of the 112 integrations appeared to be at position of known fragile sites, 46 (41%) were at the non-random chromosomal sites not previously described as 'true' fragile sites. It is possible, however, that these non-random instabilities signal of genomic regions equivalent to fragile sites, that either have not previously been detected due to low level expression or that are activated in a tissue- or cell-type-specific manner. Collectively, our results show a preferential integration of exogenous DNA into fragile sites and other non-random regions of high genomic instability in MDA-MB-436 cells. This approach has provided a platform for the efficient targeted cloning and characterization of a substantial number of both common fragile sites and other non-random instability regions possibly related to breast cancer, and possibly also to other types of cancer. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Our previous studies have demonstrated its significant downregulation in oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer cell line. The present study investigated whether it plays a role in the regulation of chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs using human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. We firstly overexpressed S100P in the OVCAR3 cell line, and evaluated the expression level of S100P by semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay indicated that overexpression of S100P sensitized OVCAR3 cells for chemotherapeutic drugs (paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and epirubicin) induced cytotoxicity more than vector-only controls. Further studies showed that downregulation of S100P by RNA interference in OVCAR3 cells led to a significant increase of resistance to each of these anticancer drugs. Taken together, our results suggest that S100P plays an important role in regulation of chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs in ovarian cancer cells. Using S100P as a molecular biomarker may increase our ability to predict tumor drug response in ovarian cancer."

The aim of the present study was to establish a HCC cell system in which p53 levels can be regulated. Full-length wild-type p53 cDNA obtained by PCR was cloned into a retroviral response vector controlled by the tetracycline responsive element (RevTRE-p53). The regulatory vectors RevTet-Off and RevTRE-p53 were transfected into a packaging cell line, PT67. Hep3B cells in which the p53 gene was deleted were infected with RevTet-Off viral particles from the PT67. Three G418-resistant cell clones with high luciferase expression and low background were infected with RevTRE-p53. By screening dozens of RevTRE-p53-infected clones with hygromycin we identified the one with the highest expression of p53 and the lowest background after doxycycline treatment. The results showed that p53 expression in this cell clone could be simply turned on or off by removing or adding doxycycline. Furthermore, it was found that the level of p53 protein was negatively and sensitively related to the doxycycline concentration. In conclusion, we have established a HCC cell line in which p53 expression can be switched on or off and regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner."

The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array.The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes, specifically, the CYP1A1and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively. Drugs efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly. TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold. Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for: cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair.The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process."

The expression of this gene was determined at the mRNA level by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction and at the protein level by Western blotting. The semi-quantitative scores of hTERT mRNA expression were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. After 72 h of exposure to TPs, the mean (+/-SD) scores of hTERT mRNA expression in TP 0.1g/l, TP 0.05 g/l and a control group were 0.32+/-0.05, 0.41+/-0.04 and 0.72+/-0.05, respectively (P<0.05). The Western blot assay showed that TPs also decreased the expression of hTERT at the protein level. These results indicate that TPs reduce hTERT activity in the human Tca8113 cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner, disabling telomerase activity and thereby terminating unlimited cancer cell proliferation. These findings suggest a mechanism behind TP's anticancer activity."

But its role in gastric cancer is still not clear. In the present study, we intended to investigate the influence of FBG2 on the growth, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and cell cycle of the gastric cancer line MKN45 and gastric cell line HFE145.\\n\\nMETHODS: As a critical component of ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, FBG2 cDNA was subcloned into a constitutive vector PCDNA3.1 followed by transfection in MKN45 and HFE145 by using liposome. Then stable transfectants were selected and appraised. The apoptosis and cell cycles of these clones were analyzed by using flow cytometry. The growth and proliferation were analyzed by cell growth curves and colony-forming assay respectively. The invasion of these clones was tested by using cancer cell migration assay. The FBG2 stable expression clones(MKN-FBG2 and HFE-FBG2) and their control groups were detected and compared respectively.\\n\\nRESULTS: MKN-FBG2 grew faster than MKN45 and MKN-PC(MKN45 transfected with PCDNA3.1 vector). HFE-FBG2 grew faster than HFE145 and HFE-PC(HFE145 transfected with PCDNA3.1 vector). The cell counts of MKN-FBG2 in the forth, fifth, sixth and seventh days were significantly more than those of others (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that MKN-FBG2 and HFE-FBG2 proliferated faster, proportions of cells in G2-M and S were different significantly with control groups (P < 0.05). Results of colony-forming assay showed that the colony formation rates of MKN-FBG2 and HFE-FBG2 were higher than those of control groups (P < 0.05). The results of cell migration assay were all negative.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: FBG2 can promote the growth and proliferation of gastric cancer cells and normal gastric cells. It can help tumor cell maintain malignant phenotype too. But it can have a negative influence on the apoptosis or the ability of invasion of gastric cancer cells."

        "abstract": "Signaling adaptor protein Crk regulates cell motility and growth through its targets Dock180 and C3G, those are the guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small GTPases Rac and Rap, respectively. Recently, overexpression of Crk has been reported in various human cancers. To define the role for Crk in human cancer cells, Crk expression was targeted in the human ovarian cancer cell line MCAS through RNA interference, resulting in the establishment of three Crk knockdown cell lines. These cell lines exhibited disorganized actin fibers, reduced number of focal adhesions, and abolishment of lamellipodia formation. Decreased Rac activity was demonstrated by pull-down assay and FRET-based time-lapse microscopy, in association with suppression of both motility and invasion by phagokinetic track assay and transwell assay in these cells. Furthermore, Crk knockdown cells exhibited slow growth rates in culture and suppressed anchorage-dependent growth in soft agar. Tumor forming potential in nude mice was attenuated, and intraperitoneal dissemination was not observed when Crk knockdown cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity. These results suggest that the Crk is a key component of focal adhesion and involved in cell growth, invasion, and dissemination of human ovarian cancer cell line MCAS."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Naringenin, a naturally occurring flavonoid found in citrus fruits, is known to have anticarcinogenic properties. We have examined the effect of Naringenin on cell proliferation of an HT-29 colon cancer cell line. METHODS: HT-29 colon cancer cells were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates. Naringenin concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 2.85 mmol were added to the wells of the Test group. The Control group contained all the elements present in the Test group with the exception of Naringenin. Cell proliferation was measured by colourimetric assay using the 2% WST-1 cell proliferation kit. RESULTS: Significant inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in HT29 colon cancer cells exposed to Naringenin at doses greater than 0.71 mmol. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role for citrus fruits as a source of chemoprotective agents for colon cancer."

        "abstract": "U87MG is a commonly studied grade IV glioma cell line that has been analyzed in at least 1,700 publications over four decades. In order to comprehensively characterize the genome of this cell line and to serve as a model of broad cancer genome sequencing, we have generated greater than 30x genomic sequence coverage using a novel 50-base mate paired strategy with a 1.4kb mean insert library. A total of 1,014,984,286 mate-end and 120,691,623 single-end two-base encoded reads were generated from five slides. All data were aligned using a custom designed tool called BFAST, allowing optimal color space read alignment and accurate identification of DNA variants. The aligned sequence reads and mate-pair information identified 35 interchromosomal translocation events, 1,315 structural variations (>100 bp), 191,743 small (<21 bp) insertions and deletions (indels), and 2,384,470 single nucleotide variations (SNVs). Among these observations, the known homozygous mutation in PTEN was robustly identified, and genes involved in cell adhesion were overrepresented in the mutated gene list. Data were compared to 219,187 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms assayed by Illumina 1M Duo genotyping array to assess accuracy: 93.83% of all SNPs were reliably detected at filtering thresholds that yield greater than 99.99% sequence accuracy. Protein coding sequences were disrupted predominantly in this cancer cell line due to small indels, large deletions, and translocations. In total, 512 genes were homozygously mutated, including 154 by SNVs, 178 by small indels, 145 by large microdeletions, and 35 by interchromosomal translocations to reveal a highly mutated cell line genome. Of the small homozygously mutated variants, 8 SNVs and 99 indels were novel events not present in dbSNP. These data demonstrate that routine generation of broad cancer genome sequence is possible outside of genome centers. The sequence analysis of U87MG provides an unparalleled level of mutational resolution compared to any cell line to date."

Cell lines are better suited than surgical samples for chromosome analysis in this cancer. This study used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) to characterize the molecular cytogenetics of ESCC in cell line KYSE180. Two pools of 12-color whole-chromosome painting probes were designed, and two rounds of FISH were performed on the same metaphase spreads. Loss of DNA copy number was observed at 4p, 5q, 6q, 9, 10p, 12p, 13, 14p, 15p, 18p, 18q, 20, 22, and Y. Chromosomal gains and translocations occurred at the entire or part of 1, 2p, 3, 4p, 5p, 5q, 6p, 7, 8, 10q, 11, 12q, 14q, 16, 17q, 19, and Xp. Seven derivative chromosomes (5, 8, 12, 14, 14, 14, and 17) presented complex translocations, each involving three or four chromosomes. No chromosomes 9, 13, or Y were detected. These results add significant information to the existing karyotype description of KYSE180 and provide detailed cytogenetic background data for appropriate use of the cell line."

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Tiam1 is a determinant of proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer, we examined the effect of the inhibition of Tiam1 expression on proliferation and metastasis. We succeeded in establishing the Tiam1 knockdown colorectal cancer cell line using human immunodeficiency virus lentivirus-mediated {RNA} interference (RNAi) and found that the silencing of Tiam1 resulted in the effective inhibition of in vitro cell growth and of the invasive ability of colorectal cancer cells. Using an orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice, we confirmed that Tiam1 silencing could reduce tumor growth by subcutaneous injection and could suppress lung and liver metastases of colorectal cancer cells. Our results suggest that Tiam1 truly plays a causal role in the metastasis of colorectal cancer and that RNAi-mediated silencing of Tiam1 may provide an opportunity to develop a new treatment strategy for colorectal cancer.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 5-Aminosalicylic acid lacks the well-known side effects associated with the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We investigated anti-carcinogenic mechanisms of 5-aminosalicylic acid on a colon cancer cell line. METHODS: MTT analysis was performed for various colon cancer cell lines. The expression of NF-kappaB and metalloproteinases was examined in either HT-29 cells treated with IL-1beta and/or 5-aminosalicylic acid. Matrigel assay was used to evaluate invasive potential of HT-29 cells. Analysis of a cDNA microarray containing 8700 genes was performed to identify the alteration of gene expression in response to treatment to 5-aminosalicylic acid. RESULTS: The use of MTT analysis showed that 5-aminosalicylic acid suppressed the growth of HT-29 cells. The activity of NF-kappaB was also decreased by combined-treatment with IL-1beta and 5-aminosalicylic acid. The use of an ELISA and zymography demonstrated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzyme activity were decreased in HT-29 cells by treatment with various concentration of 5-aminosalicylic acid. A matrigel analysis demonstrated that 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment on HT-29 significantly inhibited the invasiveness of the cells. In cDNA microarray, 163 genes following 5-aminosalicylic acid exposure showed altered expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that 5-aminosalicylic acid suppresses the growth of human colon cancer cells and is able to inhibit MMPs expression via NF-kappaB mediated cell signals and invasiveness."

        "abstract": "AIM: To establish a pancreatic cancer stem cell model using human pancreatic cancer cells in nude mice to provide a platform for pancreatic cancer stem cell research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To establish pancreatic cancer xenografts using human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990, nude mice were randomly divided into control and gemcitabine groups. When the tumor grew to a volume of 125 mm3, they treated with gemcitabine at a dose of 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml in the gemcitabine group, while the mice in control group were treated with the same volume of normal saline. Gemcitabine was given 2 times a week for 3 times. When the model was established, the proliferation of pancreatic cancer stem cells was observed by clone formation assay, and the protein and/or mRNA expression of pancreatic stem cell surface markers including CD24, CD44, CD133, ALDH, transcription factors containing Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog and Gli, the key nuclear transcription factor in Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway was detected by Western blot and/or RT-PCR to verify the reliability of this model. RESULTS: This model is feasible and safe. During the establishment, no mice died and the weight of nude mice maintained above 16.5 g. The clone forming ability in gemcitabine group was stronger than that of the control group (p<0.01). In gemcitabine group, the protein expression of pancreatic cancer stem cell surface markers including CD44, and ALDH was up-regulated, the protein and mRNA expression of nuclear transcription factor including Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog was also significantly increased (P<0.01). In addition, the protein expression of key nuclear transcription factor in Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, Gli-1, was significantly enhanced (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The pancreatic cancer stem cell model was successfully established using human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 in nude mice. Gemcitabine could enrich pancreatic cancer stem cells, simultaneously accompanied by the activation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP) plays an important role in cell apoptosis, researches of antisense oligonucleotides (ASODN) of cFLIP gene may provide a new method or protocol for treatment of human gastric cancer. This study was to explore effect of cFLIP ASODN on apoptosis of human gastric cancer cell line BGC823. METHODS: Human cervical cancer cell line HeLa was used as control, cFLIP ASODN was introduced into BGC823 cells and HeLa cells, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect cFLIP(L/S) (cellular FLIP(Short) and cellular FLIP(long)) mRNA and protein. The 5'FAM-conjugated ASODN was created complementary to a sequence that included the start site of FLIP open reading frame. After introducing, MTT was used to detect cell inhibition rate,TUNEL and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to detect cell apoptosis, and Western blot was used to detect protein level of cFLIP. RESULTS: The encoding mRNA and protein of cFLIP(L) and cFLIP(S) can be detected in both HeLa and BGC823 cells. MTT revealed that cFLIP ASODN significantly inhibited proliferation of BGC823 cells (P< 0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner. TUNEL staining detected positive FLIP expression, specific apoptotic peak can be detected before G1 peak by FCM, and Western blot revealed that protein level of cFLIP(L) and cFLIP(S) decreased significantly (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The cFLIP(L/S) mRNA and encoded proteins expressed in both HeLa and BGC823 cells. ASODN may down-regulate cFLIP(L/S) protein level, and initiate apoptosis of BGC823 cells."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to clarify the role of connexin 30 (Cx30), by transfecting three kinds of vectors that express either full length Cx30 (Cx30-Full), Cx30 devoid of C-terminal region (Cx30-DelC) or Cx30 C-terminal region (Cx30-CT), in HSC-4, a head-and-neck cancer cell line. RESULTS: Transfected Cx30-Full was localized on the plasma membrane, while Cx30-DelC and Cx30-CT was expressed in the cytoplasm or circumnuclear sites. We studied the effect on the growth rate followed by immunostaining with anti-Ki-67 (MIB-1). The MIB indices of HSC-4 cells transfected with Cx30-Full and Cx30-DelC, but not Cx30-CT were shown to be significantly higher than that of the controls. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Cx30 enhanced the proliferation of HSC-4 cells and the proliferating activity was considered to be achieved without the transport of the protein onto the plasma membrane."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs frequently misregulated in human malignancies. Here we provide evidence that the miR-106b-25 cluster, upregulated in a subset of human gastric tumors, is activated by E2F1 in parallel with its host gene, Mcm7. In turn, miR-106b and miR-93 regulate E2F1 expression, establishing a miRNA-directed negative feedback loop. Furthermore, upregulation of these miRNAs impairs the TGF\u03b2 tumor suppressor pathway, interfering with the expression of CDKN1A (p21Waf1/Cip1) and BCL2L11 (Bim). Together, these results suggest that the miR-106b-25 cluster is involved in E2F1 posttranscriptional regulation and may play a key role in the development of TGF\u03b2 resistance in gastric cancer. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, zebularine preferentially depleted DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and induced expression of cancer-related antigen genes in cancer cells relative to normal fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that zebularine can be selective toward cancer cells and may hold clinical promise as an anticancer therapy."

        "abstract": "The existence of several model systems with which to investigate a particular disease is advantageous for researchers. This is especially true for ovarian cancer, which, due to its complex and heterogeneous nature, inherently requires a large number of model systems. Here, we report a new ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cell line, designated YDOV-157, and characterized via post genomics and post proteomics. In this study, primary culture of tumor cells from ascites was performed and the cells were immortalized up to at least 60 passages in vitro. We studied the morphologies, cell proliferation, BRCA1/2 mutations, tumorigenesis capacity, and chemosensitivity of YDOV-157. Using a cDNA microarray, differentially expressed genes were identified and some of them were validated. Using proteomic analysis, we identified proteins that were differentially expressed in YDOV-157. The newly derived cell line, designated YDOV-157, grew as a monolayer and the doubling time was 102 h. When transplanted into nude mice, it initiated the formation of tumor masses with microscopic findings identical to those of the primary tumor. Chemosensitivity test showed that paclitaxel induced the highest chemosensitivity index. In microarray analysis, 2,520 probes were differently expressed, compared to human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSEs). In SYBR Green real-time PCR, the expression of E2F2 (P = 0.040) and CRABP2 genes (P = 0.030) was significantly higher in the ovarian cancer cell lines than in HOSEs. Furthermore, proteomic analysis showed that expression of 28 spots was significantly altered between YDOV-157 and HOSE. In conclusion, the newly derived YDOV-157 cell line may be an important research resource for studying cancer cell biology and should also be very useful for developing new strategies that inhibit cancer cell growth and progression."

The present study was to investigate inhibition of NF-kappaB activity on invasion of human lung cancer cell line A549 and the possible mechanism. METHODS: The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/IkappaBalpha, expressing the alpha isoform (IkappaBalpha) of the NF-kappaB inhibitor, was constructed. A549 cells were cultured in vitro and divided into non-transfection group, pcDNA3.1(+) transfected group and pcDNA3.1(+)/IkappaBalpha transfected group. The expression of IkappaBalpha was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The activity of NF-kappaB was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Invasion of A549 cells was assessed by transwell chamber assay. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detected by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/IkappaBalpha was successfully constructed and expressed in A549 cells. The activity of NF-kappaB, the number of invasive cells, the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 of A549 cells in pcDNA3.1(+)/IkappaBalpha transfected group were significantly lower than those in non-transfection group and pcDNA3.1(+) transfected group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Transfection of IkappaBalpha can inhibit NF-kappaB activity, thus inhibit cell invasion of A549, which may be through the down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions."

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a major cellular process for bulk degradation of proteins and organelles in order to maintain metabolic homeostasis, and it represents an emerging target area for cancer. Initially proposed to be a cancer-restricting process for tumor initiation, recent studies suggest that autophagy can also promote cell survival in established tumors. ATG7 is an essential autophagy gene that encodes the E1 enzyme necessary for the lipidation of the LC3 family of ubiquitin-like proteins and autophagosome formation. In this study we identified a rare case of a cancer cell line, H1650 lung adenocarcinoma, which has lost ATG7 expression due to a focal biallelic deletion within the ATG7 locus. These cells displayed no evidence of ATG7 pathway activity; however, reconstituting the cells with wild-type ATG7 restored both LC3 lipidation and downstream autophagic consumption of autophagy substrates such as the SQSTM1/p62 protein. We characterized several phenotypes reported to be influenced by autophagy, and observed an ATG7-dependent increase in cell growth and clearance of proteasome-inhibitor induced protein aggregates. Cellular changes in mitochondrial metabolism or response to nutrient starvation were unaffected by ATG7 expression. In addition, parental H1650 cells that lacked ATG7 were still able to consume autophagy substrates SQSTM1, NBR1 and TAX1BP1 via a bafilomycin A1-sensitive pathway, suggesting that these proteins were not exclusively degraded by autophagy. Overall, these findings highlight a unique outlier instance of complete loss of ATG7-dependent autophagy in a cancer cell line. The H1650 cell line may be a useful system for future studies to further understand the role of autophagy in tumorigenesis and potential redundant pathways that allow cells to circumvent the loss of ATG7-dependent autophagy in cancer."

It can enhance the invasive and metastatic potential of malignant tumors and cell lines by destroying ECM and basement. This study was to explore the effects of heparanase gene on the invasive ability of colorectal cancer cell line HT29. METHODS: Heparanase gene was transfected into HT29 cells. Cell growth kinetics was assessed by MTT assay, and in vitro invasive ability was assessed with Boyden chamber. Xenograft and orthotopic implantation of histologically intact tumor in nude mice were constructed to observe the effect of exogenous expression of heparanase gene on invasive ability of HT29 cells. RESULTS: After transfection, the growth rate of heparanase-transfected HT29 (HT29-Hpa) cells was obviously higher than those of untransfected HT29 cells and empty vector-transfected HT29 (HT29-KZ) cells; the invasive cell number was significantly larger in HT29-Hpa cells than in untransfected HT29 cells and HT29-KZ cells (45.5+/-0.5 vs. 29.3+/-0.1 and 30.1+/-0.2, P<0.01). The entity neoplasm formed by HT29-Hpa cells (12 mm x 9 mm x 10 mm) was bigger than that formed by untransfected HT29 cells (6 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm). The prevalence of liver metastasis caused by orthotopic implantation of xenograft was significantly higher in HT29-Hpa group than in control group (71.43% vs. 14.29%, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Exogenous heparanase gene can facilitate the growth, invasion, and metastasis of HT29 cells."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that radiation-induced, transient G2/M arrest could potentially sensitize tumor cells to a subsequent, well-timed radiation dose. METHODS: PC-3 human prostate cancer cells were treated using either radiotherapy or (186)Re-labeled hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate ((186)Re-HEDP) treatment in different combinations. The resulting cell cycle shift and clonogenic cell death were analyzed by DNA flow cytometry and colony forming cell assay, respectively. RESULTS: Radiation doses of 4 Gy and 8 Gy induced a transient G2/M arrest, with a maximum after approximately 16 h. The presence of 2 mM pentoxifylline effectively abrogated this radiation-induced G2 M arrest, confirming a cell-cycle checkpoint-mediated effect. A second dose of 4 Gy, timed at the height of the G2/M arrest, significantly increased clonogenic cell-kill compared to delivery after a suboptimal interval (10 h, 20 h or 25 h after the first radiation fraction). Moreover, timed second doses of 2 Gy, 3 Gy or 4 Gy yielded improved normalized treatment effects compared to non-pretreated control. Radionuclide treatment of PC-3 cells, using (186)Re-HEDP (0.74 MBq/ml and 1.48 MBq/ml; total dose: 4.1 and 8.2 Gy, respectively) also induced a dose-dependent G2/M accumulation, which sensitized the cells to a subsequent external radiation dose of 2 Gy or 4 Gy. The observed pattern of cell-cycle shift towards a predominance of the G2/M phase is in line with the lack of functional p53 in this cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced cell-cycle shift was shown to effectively confer increased radiosensitivity to prostate tumor cells. Optimally timed combination of radiotherapy and radionuclide therapy could thus significantly increase treatment efficacy."

ADRB2 inhibition confers cell invasion and transforms benign prostate epithelial cells, whereas ADRB2 overexpression counteracts EZH2-mediated oncogenesis. ADRB2 is underexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer, and clinically localized tumors that express lower levels of ADRB2 exhibit a poor prognosis.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the preventive effect of celecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitor, on the development of chemoresistance in breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and explore the mechanism of the action. METHODS: Chemoresistance phenotype was established by treating MCF-7 cells with 0.05 \u03bcg/ml doxorubicin for 7 days, and then the effect of preventive chemoresistance was investigated by the combination of same dose of doxorubicin with 10 \u03bcM celecoxib. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay was used to assess cytostatic efficacy of doxorubicin and 50% inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) of MCF-7 cells. RT-PCR was performed to examine mRNA expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) and its transcription factors c-Jun and NF-\u03baB. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of protein. Flow cytometry (FCM) was applied to analyze the expression and function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to determine the DNA-binding activity of nuclear transcription factors AP-1 and NF-\u03baB. RESULTS: Compared with sensitive MCF-7 cells, MDR1 and its transcription factors c-Jun and NF-\u03baB were up-regulated at both mRNA level (P < 0.01) and protein level (P < 0.01) by treatment with 0.05 \u03bcg/ml doxorubicin for 7 days. After co-incubation with both the same dose of doxorubicin and 10 \u03bcM celecoxib for 7 days, both mRNA level and protein level of MDR1, c-Jun and NF-\u03baB up-regulated by doxorubicin were partly reversed (P < 0.01); DNA-binding activity of nuclear transcription factors AP-1 and NF-\u03baB were inhibited; and the function of P-gp was decreased (P < 0.01). When MCF-7 cells were treated with increasing doses of doxorubicin in the presence of 10 \u03bcM celecoxib, IC50 value of doxorubicin and doxorubicin plus 10 \u03bcM celecoxib was 0.67 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.38 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Celecoxib effectively prevents the development of chemoresistance in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 induced by doxorubicin, which was partly involved in inhibiting the expression and DNA-binding activity of nuclear transcription factors AP-1 and NF-\u03baB and downstream expression and function of P-gp. Furthermore, cytostatic efficacy of celecoxib and doxorubicin on MCF-7 cell was synergistic."

The MTT assay was used to determine the growth rate of the SGC7901 cells. Activation of autophagy was monitored with monodansylcadaverin (MDC) staining following AdMax-pDC315-DRAM-EGFP treatment. Immunofluorescent staining was used to examine the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and western blotting was used to examine the expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins, including Beclin1, p53, p21 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), in the culture supernatant. The viability of the SGC7901 cells was activated by AdMax-pDC315-DRAM-EGFP treatment. The AdMax-pDC315-DRAM-EGFP-treated cells exhibited positive LC3 expression detected by immunoreactivity and MDC staining. Inductions in the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins, p53 and p21, and the autophagic protein, Beclin1, were revealed by western blot analysis. By contrast, downregulation of the apoptosis-related protein, Bcl-2, following AdMax-pDC315-DRAM-EGFP treatment was identified. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that AdMax-pDC315-DRAM-EGFP treatment resulted in upregulation of the level of autophagy and induction of cell proliferation in the SGC7901 human gastric cancer cell line in vitro."

Remarkably, resistant clones tolerated serum deprivation, adopted a CD133+ CD44- phenotype, and further exhibited loss of membrane-bound E-cadherin together with predominant nuclear ??-catenin localisation.Thus, we provide evidence for a long-term memory of acquired drug resistance, driven by multiple cellular strategies (epithelial-mesenchymal transition and selective propagation of CD133+ cells).

        "abstract": "Treatment resistance to antineoplastic drugs represents a major clinical problem. Here, we investigated the long-term stability of acquired resistance to 5-fluorouracil (FU) in an in vitro colon cancer model, using four sub-clones characterised by increasing FU-resistance derived from the cell line SW620. The resistance phenotype was preserved after FU withdrawal for 15weeks (~100 cell divisions) independent of the established level of drug resistance and of epigenetic silencing. Remarkably, resistant clones tolerated serum deprivation, adopted a CD133(+) CD44(-) phenotype, and further exhibited loss of membrane-bound E-cadherin together with predominant nuclear beta-catenin localisation. Thus, we provide evidence for a long-term memory of acquired drug resistance, driven by multiple cellular strategies (epithelial-mesenchymal transition and selective propagation of CD133(+) cells). These resistance phenomena, in turn, accentuate the malignant phenotype."

        "abstract": "Background: CD164 (Endolyn) is a sialomucin, which has been found to play roles in regulating proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Possible association of CD164 with solid cancer development remains unknown. Methods and Results: We first studied CD164 expression in biopsies from colorectal cancer, breast, and ovary cancer patients by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, and found that CD164 was strongly expressed in all the colorectal cancer samples compared to the matching normal colon tissues. The possible roles of CD164 in colon cancer development were further investigated using a well-established human colon cancer cell line HCT116. We found that knockdown of CD164 expression in HCT116 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, mobility, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The knockdown of CD164 expression was associated with decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression HCT116 cell surface and immunoprecipitation studies showed that CD164 formed complexes with CXCR4. Conclusions: CD164 is highly expressed in the colon cancer sites, and it promotes HCT116 colon cancer cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, and the effects may act through regulating CXCR4 signaling pathway. Therefore, CD164 may be a new target for diagnosis and treatment for colon cancer. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

We found that LPS-induced metastatic growth response in this model depends on both TNF?? production by host hematopoietic cells and NF-??B activation in tumor cells. Inhibition of NF-??B in both colon and mammary carcinoma cells converts the LPS-induced growth response to LPS-induced tumor regression. The latter response is TNF??-independent, but depends on another member of the TNF superfamily, TRAIL, whose receptor is induced in NF-??B-deficient cancer cells."

        "abstract": "PIK3CA is mutated in diverse human cancers, but the functional effects of these mutations have not been defined. To evaluate the consequences of PIK3CA alterations, the two most common mutations were inactivated by gene targeting in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Biochemical analyses of these cells showed that mutant PIK3CA selectively regulated the phosphorylation of AKT and the forkhead transcription factors FKHR and FKHRL1. PIK3CA mutations had little effect on growth under standard conditions, but reduced cellular dependence on growth factors. PIK3CA mutations resulted in attenuation of apoptosis and facilitated tumor invasion. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated PIK3CA signaling and preferentially inhibited growth of PIK3CA mutant cells. These data have important implications for therapy of cancers harboring PIK3CA alterations."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new treatment choice for ovarian carcinoma. Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) is a novel photosensitive reagent developed in China. This study was to investigate the photodynamic effect of HMME-based PDT on human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3. METHODS: After an incubation with 30 microg/ml HMME for different time, the fluorescent image and intracellular location of HMME in SKOV3 cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). After being treated with different doses (5-50 microg/ml) of HMME and irradiated with different optical doses (1.5-12 J/cm(2)) of laser, the survival rate of SKOV3 cells was measured by MTT assay. Mechanisms of cell death during PDT was determined by Annexin V/PI double staining technique and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Red fluorescence appeared shortly after administration of HMME and localized in cytoplasm; intracellular fluorescence intensity reached the peak after 3 h. High concentrations of HMME alone had cytotoxicity to SKOV3 cells, while laser irradiation alone had no effect on cell survival. Survival rate of SKOV3 cells was gradually decreased along with the increase of HMME concentration and laser dose, but such a trend diminished when HMME concentration reached 40 microg/ml. After treatment of HMME, the dead cells were predominantly necrosis cells. CONCLUSION: HMME has a photodynamic effect on SKOV3 cells."

In luminal epithelial cells of Akt-driven PIN, we show the concomitant induction of p27(Kip1) and senescence. Genetic ablation of p27(Kip1) led to downregulation of senescence markers and progression to cancer. In humans, p27(Kip1) and senescence markers were elevated in PIN not associated with CaP but were decreased or absent, respectively, in cancer-associated PIN and in CaP. Importantly, p27(Kip1) upregulation in mouse and human in situ lesions did not depend upon mTOR or Akt activation but was instead specifically associated with alterations in cell polarity, architecture, and adhesion molecules. These data suggest that a p27(Kip1)-driven checkpoint limits progression of PIN to CaP."

        "abstract": "Most tumor cells are sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis but sparing to normal cells, thus providing therapeutic potential for clinical use. Some tumor cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death while the sensitivity could be recruited with the existence of some chemical agents. In this study, human prostatic cancer cell line LNCaP was found to be resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis while it could be restored to TRAIL sensitivity with combination treatment of low concentration of doxorubicin. TRAIL receptor-1 (DR4) and TRAIL receptor-2 (DR5) were upregulated under the treatment of doxorubicin and verified to be responsible for TRAIL-mediated signal transduction. Furthermore, caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated and drove their autocleavage into programmed cell death. Interestingly, apoptosis-inhibitory protein c-FLIP, but not Bcl-2 and XIAP was downregulated after doxorubicin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggested that the pathway of cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL was intact but under negative control. Subtoxic concentration of doxorubicin effectively boosted TRAIL sensitivity via depletion of antiapoptotic protein. These findings support the new strategies for killing tumors with TRAIL and chemical agents."

        "abstract": "Increased oxidative stress and changes in DNA methylation are frequently detected in bladder cancer patients. We previously demonstrated a relationship between increased oxidative stress and hypomethylation of the transposable long-interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1). Promoter hypermethylation of a tumor suppressor gene, runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), may also be associated with bladder cancer genesis. In this study, we investigated changes of DNA methylation in LINE-1 and RUNX3 promoter in a bladder cancer cell (UM-UC-3) under oxidative stress conditions, stimulated by challenge with H2O2 for 72 h. Cells were pretreated with an antioxidant, tocopheryl acetate for 1 h to attenuate oxidative stress. Methylation levels of LINE-1 and RUNX3 promoter were measured by combined bisulfite restriction analysis PCR and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Levels of LINE-1 methylation were significantly decreased in H2O2-treated cells, and reestablished after pretreated with tocopheryl acetate. Methylation of RUNX3 promoter was significantly increased in cells exposed to H2O2. In tocopheryl acetate pretreated cells, it was markedly decreased. In conclusion, hypomethylation of LINE-1 and hypermethylation of RUNX3 promoter in bladder cancer cell line was experimentally induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present findings support the hypothesis that oxidative stress promotes urothelial cell carcinogenesis through modulation of DNA methylation. Our data also imply that mechanistic pathways of ROS-induced alteration of DNA methylation in a repetitive DNA element and a gene promoter might differ."

FGFR2 is amplified in breast and gastric cancer, and we report here the first characterization of FGFR2 gene amplification in colorectal cancer in the NCI-H716 colorectal cancer cell line. FGFR2 is highly expressed and activated in NCI-H716 cells, and FGFR selective small molecule inhibitors or FGFR2 shRNA strongly inhibited cell viability in vitro, indicating \"addiction\" of NCI-H716 cells to FGFR2. NCI-H716 growth in a xenograft model was also inhibited by an FGFR small molecule inhibitor. FGFR2 was required for activation of multiple downstream signaling proteins including AKT, ERK, S6RP and NFKB. Inhibition of downstream kinases such as AKT or ERK alone had modest effects on proliferation, whereas combined inhibition of AKT and ERK signaling resulted in a loss of viability similar to FGFR2 inhibition. We identified elevated FGFR2 expression in a small subset of primary colorectal cancer, however FGFR2 amplification was not observed. Although FGFR2 amplification is not common in primary colon cancer or lymph node and liver metastases, other subsets of colorectal cancer such as ascites, from which the NCI-H716 cell line was derived, have yet to be tested. These results suggest that emerging FGFR inhibitor therapeutics may have efficacy in a subset of colon cancer driven by FGFR2 amplification."

METHODS: We constructed recombinant adenovirus containing p27mt by homologous recombination in bacteria. The colorectal cancer cell line Lovo was infected with recombinant replication-defective adenovirus Ad-p27mt, and expression of p27mt was determined by Western blotting; the inhibitory effect of p27mt on Lovo cells was detected by cytometry. Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. DNA fragment analysis identified the occurrence of apoptosis. RESULTS: The recombinant adenovirus which already contained p27mt target gene was successfully constructed. When multiplicity of infection was >or= 50, the infection efficiency was 100%. After transfection of Lovo cells with Ad-p27mt the cells had high p27 expression which was identified by immunoblotting assay. PI staining and flow cytometry showed that 77.96% of colorectal cancer cells were inhibited in phase G(0)/G(1), while in the Ad-LacZ group and blank control group, 27.57% and 25.29% cells were inhibited in the same phase, respectively. DNA fragment analysis, flow cytometry and TUNEL assay demonstrated that p27mt is able to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. CONCLUSION: p27mt has an obvious blocking effect on colorectal cancer cell cycle, and most cells were inhibited in phase G(0)/G(1). Therefore, p27mt can induce apoptosis in colorectal cells."

        "abstract": "Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) are frequently implicated in human cancer, acting either as onco- genes or tumor suppressors. Here, we show that PRC2 is a critical regulator of KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer progression. Modulation of PRC2 by either Ezh2 overexpression or Eed deletion enhances KRAS-driven adenomagenesis and inflammation, respectively. Eed-loss-driven inflammation leads to massive macrophage recruitment and marked decline in tissue function. Additional Trp53 inactivation acti- vates a cell-autonomous epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program leading to an invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. A switch between methylated/acetylated chromatin underlies the tumor phenotypic evolution, prominently involving genes controlled by Hippo/Wnt signaling. Our observations in the mouse models were conserved in human cells. Importantly, PRC2 inactivation results in context-dependent pheno- typic alterations, with implications for its therapeutic application."

Since 2ME2 has limited biological accessibility and rapid metabolic degradation, the purpose of this study was to investigate the in vitro influence exerted by an analogue of 2ME2 namely 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate (2MEBM) in a breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7).\\n\\nMETHODS: This was conducted by investigating 2MEBM's in vitro influence on cell cycle progression, mitochondrial membrane potential and possible production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In vitro effects of 2MEBM on cell cycle progression was demonstrated by means of flow cytometry using propidium iodide. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide production was investigated using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and hydroethidine, respectively. The probable reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential was demonstrated using a MitoCapture\u2122 kit.\\n\\nRESULTS: Cell cycle progression revealed the presence of a sub-G1 apoptotic peak. Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential after exposure to 2MEBM was demonstrated and an increase in ROS production was also observed.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study verified that 2MEBM exposure resulted in apoptosis induction, increased ROS production and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in a tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line. Data obtained from this project contributes to the unravelling of the in vitro signal transduction of 2MEBM in tumorigenic cell lines."

We established a mouse model for neuroendocrine (NE) lung tumors by conditional inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 in mouse lung epithelial cells. Mice carrying conditional alleles for both Rb1 and Trp53 developed with high incidence aggressive lung tumors with striking morphologic and immunophenotypic similarities to SCLC. Most of these tumors, which we designate MSCLC (murine small cell lung carcinoma), diffusely spread through the lung and gave rise to extrapulmonary metastases. In our model, inactivation of both Rb1 and p53 was a prerequisite for the pathogenesis of SCLC."

Expression of microRNA was determined with microRNA array. Expression of miR-200c and miR-21 was detected by Northern blotting. RESULTS: TSA significantly inhibited the proliferation of BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. BxPC-3 cells treated with TSA were arrested in G0/G1 phase and were characterized by increased apoptotic rate, accompanied by differential expression of microRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that TSA may activate expression of microRNAs that may act as tumor suppressor in human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3."

In this study, inhibition of five glycolysis pathway molecules (GLUT1, HKII, PFKFB3, PDHK1 and LDH) using 9 inhibitors (Phloretin, Quercetin, STF31, WZB117, 3PO, 3-bromopyruvate, Dichloroacetate, Oxamic acid, NHI-1) was investigated in panels of breast and ovarian cancer cell line models. All compounds tested blocked glycolysis as indicated by increased extracellular glucose and decreased lactate production and also increased apoptosis. Sensitivity to several inhibitors correlated with the proliferation rate of the cell lines. Seven compounds had IC50 values that were associated with each other consistent with a shared mechanism of action. A synergistic interaction was revealed between STF31 and Oxamic acid when combined with the antidiabetic drug metformin. Sensitivity to glycolysis inhibition was also examined under a range of O2 levels (21% O2, 7% O2, 2% O2 and 0.5% O2) and greater resistance to the inhibitors was found at low oxygen conditions (7% O2, 2% O2 and 0.5% O2) relative to 21% O2 conditions. These results indicate growth of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines is dependent on all the targets examined in the glycolytic pathway with increased sensitivity to the inhibitors under normoxic conditions."

        "abstract": "Adaptive responses within hypoxic tumor microenvironments require the altered expression of Solute Carrier (SLC) transporters to maintain nutrient uptake in support of cellular metabolism and biosynthesis. Using a real time PCR array strategy to further characterize changes in transporter expression within a chronic hypoxia breast cancer cell line model (BT474), we have found a 31 fold increase in the expression of the thiamine transporter, SLC19A3. Thus, further investigations into the expression changes of the thiamine transporters, SLC19A2 and SLC19A3, and the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) regulating their expression were conducted. Chronic culturing of BT474 cells in 1% O2 up to 142 days consistently demonstrated a high level of SLC19A3 expression with a mean of approximately 40 fold with no change in SLC19A2. A corresponding 2 fold increase in thiamine uptake over 15 min was measured in chronic hypoxic BT474 cells compared to normoxia. Acute 1% O2 exposure of BT474 cells up to 72 h demonstrated a 7.5 fold increase in SLC19A3 expression. The chemical hypoxia mimetic deferoxamine, resulted in an approximately 70 fold increase in SLC19A3 expression. Stable shRNA knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 reduced hypoxia mediated SLC19A3 up-regulation by approximately 3 fold compared to scrambled construct. In conclusion, SLC19A3 transporter expression was observed to be up-regulated under acute, chronic and DFO induced hypoxia. The attenuated increase in SLC19A3 expression after HIF-1\u03b1 knockdown suggests a role for HIF-1\u03b1 mediated pathways regulating SLC19A3 gene expression."

Based on earlier spectral karyotype analysis of the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3, which shows an unbalanced translocation der(19)t(11;19), the aim of this study was to determine the precise breakpoints of that derivative chromosome. After rough delimitation of the breakpoints of microdissected derivative chromosomes by array analysis, we designed a matrix of primers spanning 11q13.2 and 19p13.2 detecting multiple amplicons on genomic and cDNA. Sequencing the amplicons, accurate localization of both breakpoints on both chromosomes was possible and we found that exon 14 of HOOK2 from chromosome 19 and exon 2 of ACTN3 from chromosome 11 were fused in the derivative chromosome. The breakpoint in the HOOK2 gene was in an intrinsic triplet of nucleic acids leading to a shift in the ACTN3 reading frame in the derivative chromosome. This frameshift alteration should give rise to an early stop codon causing a loss of function of ACTN3. Signals in two-dimensional Western blotting exactly match to calculated molecular mass and the isoelectric point of the fusion protein."

Recent studies have shown overexpression of Survivin in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines, which may play an important role in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer. This study was to explore the effects of Survivin short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on Survivin expression, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity of human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. METHODS: OVCAR3 cells were transfected with Survivin shRNA. Untransfected, lip-transfected, and mU6-transfected cells were set as controls. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of Survivin mRNA. Flow cytometry was applied to examine the expression of Survivin protein and cell apoptosis. MTT assay was used to examine the effect of Survivin shRNA on chemosensitivity of OVCAR3 cells. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of Survivin were obviously lower in Survivin shRNA-transfected OVCAR3 cells than in untransfected cells, lip-transfected cells, and mU6-transfected cells 24 h after transfection. The apoptotic rates of OVCAR3 cells 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h after Survivin shRNA transfection were 20.7%, 31.9%, 39.0%, and 46.7%, respectively, that showed a time-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of paclitaxel were (0.305+/-0.032) micromol/L for untransfected cells, (0.157+/-0.031) micromol/L for lip-transfected cells, (0.175+/-0.010) micromol/L for mU6-transfected cells, and (0.019+/-0.001) micromol/L for Survivin shRNA-transfected cells; and the IC50 of cisplatin were (9.410+/-0.796) micromol/L, (6.675+/-1.739) micromol/L, (6.930+/-1.273) micromol/L, and (7.862+/-0.081) micromol/L, respectively. Survivin shRNA increased the sensitivity of OVCAR3 cells to paclitaxel by 16 folds (P<0.01), but had no significant effect on the sensitivity to cisplatin (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Sequence-specific shRNA targeting Survivin can suppress the expression of Survivin gene effectively in OVCAR3 cells, and sensitize OVCAR3 cells to paclitaxel, but has no significant effect on the sensitivity to cisplatin."

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA. Many anti-tumor agents against prostate cancer cells have been developed, but their unacceptable systemic toxicity to normal tissues frequently limits their usage in clinics. Several previous studies have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce cell death in a variety of transformed cells including prostate cancer cells, but not normal cells. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical that is produced in fruits and vegetables, may play an important role in the prevention of many types of cancer, including hormone-related ones such as breast and prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the potential sensitizing effects of I3C on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. When LNCaP cells were incubated with I3C (either 30 or 90 microM) for 24 h and then treated with TRAIL (100 ng/ml), enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was observed. The enhanced apoptosis measured by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase 3 cleavage. We also observed that loss of cell viability after treatment with I3C/TRAIL is greater compared with I3C and TRAIL alone. To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the enhanced apoptosis, we examined the expression of two TRAIL death receptors (DR4 and DR5) and two TRAIL decoy receptors (DcR1 and DcR2). We found that treatment with I3C induced DR4 and DR5 expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. These findings suggest that I3C may be an effective sensitizer of TRAIL treatment against TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP."

However, how PTEN loss is involved in CRPC development is not clear. Here, we show that castration-resistant growth is an intrinsic property of Pten null prostate cancer (CaP) cells, independent of cancer development stage. PTEN loss suppresses androgen-responsive gene expressions by modulating androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor activity. Conditional deletion of Ar in the epithelium promotes the proliferation of Pten null cancer cells, at least in part, by downregulating the androgen-responsive gene Fkbp5 and preventing PHLPP-mediated AKT inhibition. Our findings identify PI3K and AR pathway crosstalk as a mechanism of CRPC development, with potentially important implications for CaP etiology and therapy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

The postoperative survival rate was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The roles of miR-224 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion were analyzed with pre-miR-224 transfected cells. In addition, the regulation of SMAD4 by miR-224 was evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assays.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-224 was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissue samples and associated with disease relapse and a relative poorer disease-free survival rate. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-224 potently promoted tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, the over-expression of miR-224 in CRC cell lines decreased SMAD4 expression at the translational level and decreased SMAD4-driven luciferase-reporter activity.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that miR-224 could play an oncogenic role in the cellular processes of CRC and represent a novel biomarker for tumor relapse of CRC patients."

        "abstract": "The mechanism for cell-cycle-dependent regulation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) activity was investigated using synchronized culture of Colo201, a human colon cancer cell line. In the synchronized culture, it was found that GnT-III activity rapidly increased in the M phase and the maximal activity was five times higher than the basal level found in the G1 phase. Northern blot and Western blot analyses revealed that the increase in the activity is due not to an increase in expression level of its mRNA but, rather, to the level of protein. Furthermore, it was shown by a pulse-chase experiment that the increased protein level of GnT-III is the result of its prolonged turnover rate. Lectin blotting with erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin showed that the content of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine structure in glycoproteins was transiently increased during the M phase in conjunction with the increased activity of GnT-III. These results suggest that GnT-III activity undergoes a cell-cycle-dependent regulation and thereby oligosaccharide structures of N-glycans vary specifically during the M phase of the cell cycle. Thus, it is possible that the cell-cycle-dependent alteration of N-glycans by GnT-III might play a role in biological events, such as the progression of cell cycle and cell division."

Its dysfunction is supposed to be involved in tumorigenesis and development. This study was to construct a course recombination enzyme(CRE)-dependent short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid targeting Notch1, and investigate its effect on proliferation of cervical cancer cell line HeLa. METHODS: RNA interfering vectors pSico and pSicoR were used to construct CRE-dependent shRNA expression plasmids targeting GAPDH and Notch1; pBS185-CRE was used as an expression vector of CRE. HeLa cells were divided into 4 groups and transfected with pSico, pSico/CRE, pSicoR, and pSicoR/CRE, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were carried out to assess the efficiency of RNA interference (RNAi), and intracellular Notch signal level was tested by CBF-1 reporter plasmid. The proliferation of HeLa cells after CRE-dependent Notch1 RNAi was detected by MTS assay. RESULTS: After transfection of pSico (R)-GAPDH and pSico (R)-Notch1, CRE-dependent green fluorescent cells were detected; Notch1 expression was inhibited; intracellular Notch1 signal level was decreased; the proliferation of HeLa cells was suppressed. CONCLUSION: RNAi of Notch1 mediated by CRE-dependent shRNA expression plasmid can down-regulate intracellular Notch1 signal level and suppress the proliferation of HeLa cells."

        "abstract": "To investigate the mechanisms involved in PCa (prostate cancer) metastasis and CXCR4 (CXC chemokine receptor-4)-mediated VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) expression, we used lentivirus-mediated RNAi (RNA interference) to reduce the expression of CXCR4 in a PCa cell line. We found that the silencing of CXCR4 led to a significant down-regulation of VEGF and MMP-9 at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with the control in vitro. Using an animal model, we confirmed that CXCR4 silencing via subcutaneous injection could reduce tumour growth as well as inhibit metastasis, particularly bone metastasis, of PCa. Using in vivo immunohistochemistry, we also found that the expression of VEGF and MMP-9 were reduced by the knockdown of CXCR4 in the primary tumours of mice. Collectively, our results indicate that CXCR4 plays an important role in PCa metastasis through the up-regulation of VEGF and MMP-9. These findings may aid future intervention strategies."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Accumulative evidences have indicated the importance of CD40-CD40L receptor-ligand pair in the initiation and regulation of human immune response. Whether triggering CD40-CD40L signaling pathway could induce antitumor effects in ovarian cancer cells is still unclear. This study was to investigate the biological and antitumor effects of CD40L on ovarian cancer cell line OVHM (CD40-positive). METHODS: CD40L cDNA was transfected into OVHM cells by lipofectamine 2000. Immunofluorescent technique and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the expression of CD40, CD40L, MHC-I, MHC-II, CD80, CD86. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. CD40L/OVHM and OVHM cells were inoculated hypodermically into C57BL/6N x C3H/He F1 (B6C3F1) mice and BALB/c nude mice simultaneously. Tumor volume was measured. The production of IFN-gamma secreted by the spleen cells from CD40L/OVHM and OVHM cell-inoculated mice co-cultured with 20 Gy-irridiated OVHM cells were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Expression of CD40L in OVHM/CD40L cells was significantly higher than that in OVHM cells (P<0.05). Moreover, the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 of CD40L/OVHM was increased (P<0.05). The proliferation rate of parental and CD40L-expressed OVHM cells were not different. Although, delayed tumor growth was observed when CD40L-expressing OVHM cells and OVHM cells were injected simultaneously and contralaterally, the tumor growth of OVHM and CD40L/OVHM in BALB/c nude mice was not different. The amounts of IFN-gamma secreted by the co-culture of irradiated OVHM cells with spleen cells from mice injected with CD40L/OVHM were much higher than those from OVHM/parental cell inoculated and naive mice. CONCLUSION: The forced expression of CD40L cDNA in OVHM cells can increase the immunogenicity, and thus develop antitumor effects against OVHM-incubated mice. In vivo immunization of immunocompetent mice with CD40L/OVHM improves the generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes against parent ovarian cancer cells."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in post-transcriptional gene silencing of target messenger RNAs, which are involved in virtually all biological processes. Previously, we have demonstrated that spheroid body-forming cells from the MKN-45 cancer cell line possessed gastric cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. In this study, we aimed to determine the miRNA profile of the gastric CSCs and to explore the role of miRNAs in gastric CSCs. Human miRNA microarrays, which contain probes specific for 1887 human miRNAs were used to determine the expression profiles of the gastric CSCs. A total of 182 miRNAs with a more than 2-fold change were identified to be differentially expressed between the spheroid body-forming cells and the parental cells. Of these miRNAs, 9 miRNAs were over-expressed in the spheroid body-forming cells, while the other 173 miRNAs were all under-expressed, indicating that the role of most miRNAs in human gastric CSCs may be tumor suppressors. The results of microarray analysis were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the consistence rate is 70% (7 out of 10). The target genes for the validated miRNAs were predicted by using three online software programs, miRanda, PicTar, and TargetScan. Most of the potential targets of the miRNAs were relevant to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and the pathways in cancer. Especially, several genes are associated with some pivotal signaling pathways of the 'stem cell genes'. Evaluating the characteristic miRNAs of the gastric CSCs may be a new method for studying gastric cancer and developing therapeutic strategies, which aimed at eradicating the subpopulation of CSCs in gastric cancer."

It remains unclear how LKB1 inactivation coordinates tumor progression with metabolic adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here in Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Lkb1<sup>lox/lox</sup> (KL) mouse model, we reveal differential reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ROS can modulate ADC-to-SCC transdifferentiation (AST). Further, pentose phosphate pathway deregulation and impaired fatty acid oxidation collectively contribute to the redox imbalance and functionally affect AST. Similar tumor and redox heterogeneity also exist in human NSCLC with LKB1 inactivation. In preclinical trials toward metabolic stress, certain KL ADC can develop drug resistance through squamous transdifferentiation. This study uncovers critical redox control of tumor plasticity that may affect therapeutic response in NSCLC."

Human cervical cancer cell line HeLa was found to be more sensitive to dicitratolanthanum (III) complex ([LaCit2]3-) than other cancer cell lines. However, the effect and mechanism of dicitratoytterbium (III) complex ([YbCit2]3-) on HeLa cells is unknown. Using biochemical and comparative proteomic analyses, [YbCit2]3- was found to inhibit HeLa cell growth and induce apoptosis. Similar to the effects of [LaCit2]3-, proteomics results from [YbCit2]3--treated cells revealed profound changes in proteins relating to mitochondria and oxidative stress, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in [YbCit2]3--induced apoptosis. This was confirmed by the decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the increased generation of reactive oxygen species in [YbCit2]3--treated cells. Western blot analysis showed that [YbCit2]3--induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-9 and specific proteolytic cleavage of PARP, leading to an increase in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results suggest a mitochondrial pathway of cell apoptosis in [YbCit2]3--treated cells, which will help us understand the molecular mechanisms of lanthanide-induced apoptosis in tumor cells. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The expression of this gene was determined at the mRNA level by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction and at the protein level by Western blotting. The semi-quantitative scores of hTERT mRNA expression were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. After 72 h of exposure to TPs, the mean (+/-SD) scores of hTERT mRNA expression in TP 0.1g/l, TP 0.05 g/l and a control group were 0.32+/-0.05, 0.41+/-0.04 and 0.72+/-0.05, respectively (P<0.05). The Western blot assay showed that TPs also decreased the expression of hTERT at the protein level. These results indicate that TPs reduce hTERT activity in the human Tca8113 cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner, disabling telomerase activity and thereby terminating unlimited cancer cell proliferation. These findings suggest a mechanism behind TP's anticancer activity."

We examined 13 sequence-tagged site (STS) markers mapped along 9q32-q33 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and used 13 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)/bacteriophage P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) genomic clone probes representing these STS markers as probes for dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses to define the deleted region cytogenetically and at the molecular level. Southern blotting confirmed the findings. This combination of techniques revealed that the homozygous deletion in the KYBTDS cell line involved less than 1 megabase of DNA, flanked by markers A003P42 and SGC33380. This interval overlaps part of a common region of deletion observed in a number of primary bladder cancers; moreover, the DNA sequence within the 1-Mb segment corresponds to part of a YAC genomic clone that encompasses a putative tumor suppressor gene, DBCCR1."

The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay. The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array. The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes, specifically, the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively. Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly. TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold. Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process."

        "abstract": "Estrogens produced within breast tumors may play a pivotal role in growth stimulation of the breast cancer cells. However, it is elusive whether the epithelial breast cancer cells themselves synthesize estrogens, or whether the surrounding tumor stromal cells synthesize and supply the cancer cells with estrogen. The aromatase enzyme catalyzes the estrogen production, aromatizing circulating androgens into estrogens. The aim of this study was to investigate aromatase expression and function in a model system of human breast cancer, using the estrogen responsive human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Cells were cultured in a low estrogen milieu and treated with estrogens, aromatizable androgens or non-aromatizable androgens. Cell proliferation, expression of estrogen-regulated proteins and aromatase activity were investigated. The MCF-7 cell line was observed to express sufficient aromatase enzyme activity in order to aromatize the androgen testosterone, resulting in a significant cell growth stimulation. The testosterone-mediated growth effect was completely inhibited by the aromatase inhibitors letrozole and 4-hydroxy-androstenedione. Expression studies of estrogen-regulated proteins confirmed that testosterone was aromatized to estrogen in the MCF-7 cells. Thus, the results indicate that epithelial breast cancer cells possess the ability to aromatize circulating androgens to estrogens. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "The telomere and the telomerase in human esophageal cancer are not yet completely understood. The regulatory mechanism of telomerase activity and telomere dynamics has drawn considerable attention. It is generally assumed that when telomerase has been activated, no further telomere shortening should ensue; however, a much more complex pattern of telomere dynamics may exist in telomerase-positive cancer cells. A novel human esophageal cancer cell line (KAN-ES) was established and characterized. Using KAN-ES and its serially passaged subclones up to the 55th generation, we determined the alteration of telomere length (TRF), telomerase activity (TA), telomerase RNA expression (hTR), population doubling time, karyotype, and cytokeratin 14 expression during the process of establishing a cancer cell line. We found that the TRF was maintained between 4.0 and 5.0 kb during the serial passages, despite sustained high TA (assessed by an in vitro TRAP assay). No close relationships were found among TRF, TA, and hTR expression. TA and telomere dynamics were not associated with cellular growth ability and differentiation. However, the number of population doublings showed significant correlations with both the TA and doubling times. In conclusion, these dissociations between telomere dynamics and TA support the existence of additional controls on TRF in cancer cells. KAN-ES and its restored subclones should prove a valuable resourse for esophageal cancer research."

In agreement with this, we show in this study that induced expression of ER\u03b2 in the breast cancer cell line T47D reduces 17\u03b2-estradiol-stimulated proliferation when expression of ER\u03b2 mRNA equals that of ER\u03b1. Induction of ER\u03b2 reduces growth of exponentially proliferating cells with a concomitant decrease in components of the cell cycle associated with proliferation, namely cyclin E, Cdc25A (a key regulator of Cdk2), p45Skp2 (a key regulator of p27Kip1 proteolysis), and an increase in the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. We also observed a reduced Cdk2 activity. These findings suggest a possible role for ER\u03b2 in breast cancer and imply that ER\u03b2-specific ligands may reduce proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells through actions on the G1 phase cell-cycle machinery."

This work aimed at analyzing the correlation between the expression of GRP78 and an anticancer drug, topoisomerase II inhibitor-VP-16, in human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 using this microchip-based system. The cells were cultured on a PDMS chip, the expression of GRP78 at both protein and mRNA levels for the cells under the condition with or without the induction of A23187 were assayed by immunofluorescence and chip electrophoresis, respectively. Then the cells were treated by VP-16, percentages of apoptosis and the cycle distributions of the cells were detected by flow cytometry. The cells cultured on the PDMS attached and spread well to micro-channels with high viability. Compared with the non-induced cells, the expression of GRP78 at both protein and mRNA levels for the A23187-induced cells were increased greatly. After treatment by VP-16, the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased nearly threefold for the A23187-induced cells in contrast to the non-induced cells (13.15 +/- 3.84% versus 34.03 +/- 11.45%), and the cells distributed in S phase reduced dramatically (11.96 +/- 1.27% versus 20.76 +/- 3.05%) whereas in G(1) phase increased greatly (74.16 +/- 0.95% versus 57.06 +/- 4%). GRP78 is correlated to the resistance to VP-16 in human lung cancer cell line. The microchip-based system has the potential application and feasibility for cell culture and its functional research."

The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities of N sativa extracts are well known. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the anticancer activity of seed extract (NSE) and seed oil (NSO) of N sativa against a human lung cancer cell line. Cells were exposed to 0.01 to 1 mg/ml of NSE and NSO for 24 h, then percent cell viability was assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays, and cellular morphology by phase contrast inverted microscopy. The results showed NSE and NSO significantly reduce the cell viability and alter the cellular morphology of A-549 cells in a concentration dependent manner. The percent cell viability was recorded as 75%, 50%, and 26% at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml of NSE by MTT assay and 73%, 48%, and 23% at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml of NSE by NRU assay. Exposure to NSO concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml and above for 24 h was also found to be cytotoxic. The decrease in cell viability at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml of NSO was recorded to be 89%, 52%, 41%, and 13% by MTT assay and 85%, 52%, 38%, and 11% by NRU assay, respectively. A-549 cells exposed to 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml of NSE and NSO lost their typical morphology and appeared smaller in size.

Two pools of 12-color whole-chromosome painting probes were designed, and two rounds of FISH were performed on the same metaphase spreads. Loss of DNA copy number was observed at 4p, 5q, 6q, 9, 10p, 12p, 13, 14p, 15p, 18p, 18q, 20, 22, and Y. Chromosomal gains and translocations occurred at the entire or part of 1, 2p, 3, 4p, 5p, 5q, 6p, 7, 8, 10q, 11, 12q, 14q, 16, 17q, 19, and Xp. Seven derivative chromosomes (5, 8, 12, 14, 14, 14, and 17) presented complex translocations, each involving three or four chromosomes. No chromosomes 9, 13, or Y were detected. These results add significant information to the existing karyotype description of KYSE180 and provide detailed cytogenetic background data for appropriate use of the cell line."

        "abstract": "The increased inhaled application of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2) NPs) increases the potential pulmonary health risks. The present investigations were carried out to study the TiO(2) NPs-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and genotoxicity in the human lung cancer cell line, A549, a widely used cell system for pulmonary toxicity studies. Tetrazolium bromide salt and lactate dehydrogenase release assays were used to study the cytotoxicity. The genotoxicity studies were carried out using cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. Apoptosis was confirmed by the formation of apoptotic bodies and altered expression (messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein) of markers such as P(53), P(21), Bax, Bcl(2) and cleaved caspase-3. Cells exposed to TiO(2) NPs (10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 6-24\u00a0h shows significant induction in oxidative stress, that is, the production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde and decrease in the activity of catalase and glutathione. TiO(2) NPs exposure also induces the formation of apoptotic bodies and micronucleus as marker of genotoxicity. A significant up-regulation in the expression of apoptosis markers such as P(53), P(21) and cleaved caspase-3 was observed, while the levels were down-regulated for Bcl(2) at both mRNA and protein levels. TiO(2) NPs exposure could not pose significant effects on Bax expression. Data indicate that nano-TiO(2) induces oxidative stress, genotoxicity and apoptosis in human lung cancer cell line, A549. Our result also identifies the mechanisms involved in TiO(2) NP-induced changes in A549 cells. Perhaps, reporting for the first time, the association of TiO(2) NPs-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis at transcriptional and translational level in the human lung cancer cell line, A549 cells."

We intended to examine the presence of estrogenic growth factor effects in an ER alpha-negative breast cancer cell line. By means of reporter gene assays, we investigated the activation of estrogen response elements (EREs) by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the estrogen-unresponsive cell line MDA-MB-231. Our results demonstrate the H-ras-dependent activation of EREs after EGF treatment in this estrogen-unresponsive cell line, an effect which was not observed in the ERalpha/beta-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the transcriptional activity of an ERE-containing promotor was enhanced dose dependently by all tested EGF concentrations. This effect could be blocked by co-treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors AG1478 and ZD1839, as well as by co-transfection with a vector coding for a dominant negative H-ras mutant, but not by co-treatment with the pure antiestrogen ICI182,780. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active H-ras was shown to be sufficient to activate EREs in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results suggest alternative utilization of ERE-mediated gene regulation in an estradiol-unresponsive breast cancer cell line in response to an EGF stimulus. This mechanism was shown to be dependent on EGFR and H-ras activity, but independent of the presence of functional ERalpha."

        "abstract": "Deregulation of E2F1 activity and resistance to TGF beta are hallmarks of gastric cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs frequently misregulated in human malignancies. Here we provide evidence that the miR-106b-25 cluster, upregulated in a subset of human gastric tumors, is activated by E2F1 in parallel with its host gene, Mcm7. In turn, miR-106b and miR-93 regulate E2F1 expression, establishing a miRNA-directed negative feedback loop. Furthermore, upregulation of these miRNAs; impairs the TGF beta tumor suppressor pathway, interfering with the expression of CDKN1A (p21(Waf1/Cip1)) and BCL2L11 (Bim). Together, these results suggest that the miR-106b-25 cluster is involved in E2F1 posttranscriptional regulation and may play a key role in the development of TGF beta resistance in gastric cancer."

ADAM17 protein, a major ErbB ligand sheddase, is upregulated in NSCLC and is required not only for heregulin-dependent HER3 signaling, but also for EGFR ligand-dependent signaling in NSCLC cell lines. A selective ADAM inhibitor, INCB3619, prevents the processing and activation of multiple ErbB ligands, including heregulin. In addition, INCB3619 inhibits gefitinib-resistant HER3 signaling and enhances gefitinib inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC. These results show that ADAM inhibition affects multiple ErbB pathways in NSCLC and thus offers an excellent opportunity for pharmacological intervention, either alone or in combination with other drugs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Normal breast tissue mainly expresses the neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y2 receptor whereas primary human breast carcinomas express the Y1 receptor (Y1R) subtype. We hypothesized that activation of estrogen signaling systems plays a role in the induction of Y1R. To investigate this possibility, we used estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, and examined the effect of estrogen on Y1R gene expression and its signaling pathways. Saturation binding studies revealed that MCF-7 cells express high-affinity NPY receptor. NPY inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and mobilized intracellular Ca2+ in MCF-7 cells. Chronic estrogen treatment enhanced NPY-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation by 4-fold and caused a significant increase in Y1R mRNA expression through ER{alpha}. Similarly, estrogen increased Y1R mRNA expression in T-47D (ER+) but not in MDA-MB231 or MDA-MB468 (ER-) cell lines. Cycloheximide decreased basal Y1R mRNA expression; however, it did not affect its increase by estrogen. Moreover, estrogen treatment of MCF-7 cells did not increase Y1R mRNA stability. The up-regulation of Y1R expression by estrogen is prevented by hydroxyurea but not by nocodazole or IB-MECA (cell cycle inhibitors). Lastly, NPY inhibited estrogen-induced cell proliferation through Y1R. In conclusion, MCF-7 cells express a functional Y1R coupled to both Ca2+ and cAMP pathways. Estrogen up-regulates Y1R expression through ER{alpha}. This effect is independent of increased Y1R mRNA stability or new protein synthesis, and likely occurs during S phase completion of the cell cycle. Estrogen plays an important role in the up-regulation of Y1R, which in turn regulates estrogen-induced cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(7): 3706-14)"

Perturbation of this circuit with ErbB3-directed RNAi decreased cell growth in\u00a0three-dimensional culture and resulted in decreased disease progression and prolonged survival in\u00a0a xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a monoclonal ErbB3-directed antibody (MM-121) also significantly inhibited tumor growth in\u00a0vivo.

Previous studies have demonstrated an anticancer effect of the A. officinarum extract and its major components in several cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of this extract in breast cancer cells have not been fully elucidated to date. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of a methanolic extract of A. officinarum, by examining its effects on the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Notably, the extract inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation in a dose- and time\u2011dependent manner. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism, we examined whether the A. officinarum extract affected cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. The extract inhibited S-phase cell cycle progression by suppressing the expression levels of S-phase cell cycle regulatory proteins, including E2F1, cyclin\u2011dependent protein kinase 2 and cyclin A. Additionally, nuclear morphology and flow cytometry with Annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining demonstrated that apoptosis was induced. Western blot analysis using antibodies against apoptosis\u2011related proteins showed that cell death induced by the extract is mediated via caspase\u2011 and mitochondrial\u2011dependent pathways. These findings collectively indicate that the A. officinarum extract exerts an antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis."

Synergy was assessed using combination Index method. The expression of apoptosis related markers Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were assessed by RT-PCR, whereas, the active caspase-3 protein expression was determined using imunocytochemistry.\\n\\nRESULTS: Both NA-2 and TMZ inhibited the growth of U87 in a dose dependent manner. The combine administration of NA-2 (0.33\u00a0mM) and temozolomide (0.1\u00a0mM) significantly enhanced the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Furthermore RT-PCR and imunocytochemistry data revealed that cooperative apoptosis induction was associated with increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and active Caspase-3 expression.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our findings support that NA-2 possesses strong apoptotic activity and the combined administration of NA-2 and TMZ may be therapeutically exploited for the management of GBM."

        "abstract": "Background Cancer stem cell-like side population (SP) cells, which may be responsible for recurrence, tumor metastasis, and resistance to cancer therapy, have been identified and characterized in several types of cell lines from gastric cancer. However, there is no report on isolation of SP cells from human gastric cancer cell line HGC-27. This study aims to analyze the proportion of SP cells in HGC-27 cell line, differentiate SP from non-side population (NSP) cells, and determine whether the SP cells have certain biological properties of stem cells. Material and Methods (1) HGC-27 suspension was prepared and stained with Hoechst33342 and PI for flow cytometric isolation of SP (2). Differences in proliferation and stemness-related gene expression profiles (CD133, CD44, OCT-4, MDR1, EpCAM, and ABCG2) between SP and NSP cells were detected by gastric formation assay and quantitative real-time PCR (3). Oncogenicity of SP and NSP cells was determined in nude mice in vivo. Results (1) SP cells accounted for 0.1-1.0% of HGC-27 cells, and decreased to 0% after verapamil inhibition. Using flow cytometry, we sorted 7.5x10^5 SP cells and most HGC-27 cells were NSP cells (2). Gastric formation assay and MTT demonstrated that there was a significant difference in proliferation between SP and NSP cells. Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of genes was significantly higher in SP cells (3). The oncogenicity experiment in nude mice revealed that 105 SP cells were able to form tumors, which demonstrated higher tumorigenicity than non-SP cells. Conclusions These results collectively suggested that SP cells from HGC-27 cell line have some cancer stem cell properties and could be used for studying the pathogenesis of gastric cancer, which may contribute to discovery of novel therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "The Polycomb group (PcG) protein EZH2 possesses oncogenic properties for which the underlying mechanism is unclear. We integrated in vitro cell line, in vivo tumor profiling, and genome-wide location data to nominate key targets of EZH2. One of the candidates identified was ADRB2 (Adrenergic Receptor, Beta-2), a critical mediator of beta-adrenergic signaling. EZH2 is recruited to the ADRB2 promoter and represses ADRB2 expression. ADRB2 inhibition confers cell invasion and transforms benign prostate epithelial cells, whereas ADRB2 overexpression counteracts EZH2-mediated oncogenesis. ADRB2 is underexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer, and clinically localized tumors that express lower levels of ADRB2 exhibit a poor prognosis. Taken together, we demonstrate the power of integrating multiple diverse genomic data to decipher targets of disease-related genes."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes ~85% of lung cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying the progression of NSCLC remain unclear. In this study, we found the mRNA and protein expression levels of integrin alphav are both increased in NSCLC tissues compared to healthy ones, which indicates that integrin alphav may play an important role in NSCLC progression. To further investigate the roles of integrin alphav in NSCLC, we overexpressed the integrin alphav gene in the NSCLC cell line A549, and found that the cell proliferative ability increased. The apoptosis of A549 cells was inhibited with overexpression of integrin alphav. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the role of integrin alphav in promoting NSCLC progression, we studied the expression of proteins from a number of important pathways associated with tumorigenesis, and found that the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway may be involved in the mediation of the observed integrin alphav effects. component of an important pathway for tumorigenesis, the ERK 1/2. Following inhibition of ERK 1/2 signaling, the proliferation of A549 cells induced by integrin alphav was reduced, while the inhibition of apoptosis was attenuated. Our findings demonstrate that integrin alphav promotes the proliferation of the human lung cancer cell line A549 by activating the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway, which suggests that this pathway may be a promising target for the treatment of human lung cancer."

Comparing with the parental cells MNK45, drug resistance indexes of 5-Fu, PTX, OXA, Sn38, GEM and VP16 in MNK45/HYP cells were respectively 5.3, 1.3, 3.6, 2.2, 4.8 and 4.4. Colony forming ability of MNK45/HYP cells after irradiation was also significantly higher than MNK45 cells. The invasive number of MNK45/HYP cells was 107.7\u00b117.5, while that of MNK45 cells was 59.0\u00b19.9.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Klotho, as a new anti-aging gene, can shed into circulation and act as a multi-functional humoral factor that influences multiple biological processes. Recently, published studies suggest that klotho can also serve as a potential tumor suppressor. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of klotho in human lung cancer cell line A549. METHODS: In this study, plasmids encoding klotho or klotho specific shRNAs were constructed to overexpress or knockdown klotho in vitro. A549 cells were respectively treated with pCMV6-MYC-KL or klotho specific shRNAs. The MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of klotho and flow cytometry was utilized to observe and detect the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by klotho. The activation of IGF-1/insulin signal pathways in A549 cells treated by pCMV6-MYC-KL or shRNAs were evaluated by western blotting. The expression levels of bcl-2 and bax transcripts were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Overexpression of klotho reduced the proliferation of lung cancer A549 cells, whereas klotho silencing in A549 cells enhanced proliferation. Klotho did not show any effects on HEK-293 cells. Klotho overexpression in A549 cells was associated with reduced IGF-1/insulin-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R (IGF-1 receptor)/IR (insulin receptor) (P < 0.01). Overexpression of klotho can promote the apoptosis of A549 cells (P < 0.01). Overexpression of klotho, a bcl family gene bax, was found up-regulated and bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis gene, was found down-regulated (P < 0.01). In contrast, bax and bcl-2 were found down-regulated (P < 0.05) and up-regulated (P < 0.01), respectively when silencing klotho using shRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Klotho can inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of A549 cells, this may be partly due to the inhibition of IGF-1/insulin pathways and involving regulating the expression of the apoptosis-related genes bax/bcl-2. Thus, klotho can serve as a potential tumor suppressor in A549 cells."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Vincristine (VCR)-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/VCR is a typical multidrug resistant (MDR) cell line with high expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). However, verapamil (VRP), the inhibitor of P-gp, can not totally reverse the drug resistance, indicating that additional mechanisms must contribute to the MDR phenotype. Our previous study showed that sorcin, a calcium-binding protein, is significantly up-regulated in SGC7901/VCR cells. This study was to explore the role of sorcin in the development of MDR in human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. METHODS: The full length sorcin cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The FLAG-sorsin-pcDNA3.1 plasmid was constructed and transfected into SGC7901 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of sorcin in stable clones were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The sensitivity of SGC7901 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs was detected using MTT assay. Then sorcin-transfected SGC7901 cells (SGC-F-Sor) were transfected with sorcin antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). The VCR-sensitivity of SGC7901 cells was determined by MTT assay. RESULTS: The full-length sorcin cDNA (616 bp) was amplified by RT-PCR. The FLAG-sorsin-pcDNA3.1 plasmid was constructed successfully. The mRNA and protein levels of sorcin were up-regulated in SGC-F-Sor cells. Overexpression of sorcin produced 8.87 folds of VCR-resistance, 6.13 folds of adriamycin (ADM)-resistance, 6.67 folds of taxol-resistance, and 2.80 folds of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistance. However, when SGC-F-Sor cells were transfected with sorcin ASO, down-regulation of sorcin expression and increased sensitivity to VCR were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of sorcin could induce low level of MDR in SGC7901 cells, indicating that sorcin is associated with MDR of SGC7901 cells. Sorcin maybe be a target of MDR reversal in gastric cancer cells."

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a cellular housekeeping process that removes damaged or unwanted cellular components and recycles them to build new constituents. It is essential for tumor growth under adverse environment. Mitochondria play an important role in the formation of autophagosome and its subsequent docking and fusion with lysosome. To understand the contribution of mitochondria to the regulation of homeostatic autophagy in cancer cells, we used the transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) model. Cybrid system allowed us to compare mitochondria from different cell types including highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (c231), less metastatic breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-436 (c436) and MDA-MB-468 (c468), as well as non-cancerous mammary epithelial cell MCF-10A (c10A) in a defined nuclear background. The c231 exhibited lower LC3-II levels but higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I than c436, c468 and c10A. In addition, c231 displayed more punctate LC3-positive cells and had lower levels of sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) than other cybrids. These suggested that mitochondria could contribute to the increased autophagy and autophagic flux in metastatic cancer. This increased autophagy was found to be non-selective autophagy instead of selective mitophagy since LC3 puncta in c231 did not co-localize with mitochondria labeled by Mitotracker red or Tomm 20. The promotion of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in c231 also contributed to increased autophagy. Block of MPT by the inhibition of low-conductance stage of MPT pores resulted in a decrease of LC3 puncta in c231. These results suggested that mitochondria from highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 can promote homeostatic autophagy of cancer through opening low-conductance MPT pores. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, there is significant interest in understanding the molecular signaling pathways that connect TNF-\u03b1 with the survival of tumor cells. In our experiments, we used as an in vitro model for triple negative breast cancer the cell line Hs578T. The purpose of this study is to determine the gene expression profiling of apoptotic signaling networks after blocking TNF-\u03b1 formation by using specially designed siRNA molecules to target TNF-\u03b1 messenger RNA. Knockdown of TNF-\u03b1 gene was associated with cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis, as observed by monitoring the cell index using the xCELLigence RTCA System and flow cytometry. PCR array technology was used to examine the transcript levels of 84 genes involved in apoptosis. 15 genes were found to be relevant after comparing the treated group with the untreated one of which 3 were down-regulated and 12 up-regulated. The down-regulated genes are all involved in cell survival, whereas the up-regulated ones are involved in and interact with pro-apoptotic pathways. The results described here indicate that the direct target of TNF-\u03b1 in the Hs578T breast cancer cell line increases the level of certain pro-apoptotic factors that modulate different cellular networks that direct the cells towards death."

Disruption of E-cadherin caused massive formation of intratumoral vessels that was reversible in the early phase of induction. Vascularized tumors grew more rapidly, developed invasive fronts, and gave rise to micrometastasis. \u03b2-catenin was identified as a critical effector of E-cadherin disruption leading to upregulation of VEGF-A and VEGF-C.

We also provide evidence that the miRNA profile of ESFT CSCs is the result of reversible disruption of TARBP2-dependent miRNA maturation. Restoration of TARBP2 activity and systemic delivery of synthetic forms of either of two of its targets, miRNA-143 or miRNA-145, inhibited ESFT CSC clonogenicity and tumor growth in vivo.

Examination of tumor tissues from various types of cancers revealed high levels of Flt-4 and VEGF-C expression that correlated closely with clinical metastasis and patient survival.

The expression of endogenous transferrin was found to be regulated by IL-18. Furthermore, we found that the MAPK pathway is involved in IL-18-induced transferrin production. In conclusion, IL-18 is suggested as an inducer of endogenous transferrin expression in breast cancer cells."

        "abstract": "Stress has long been thought of to be associated with increased risk of cancer. Chronic stress is associated with elevated levels of sympathetic neurotransmitter (norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y: NPY) release and immunosuppression. The expression of NPY receptors has been reported in human breast carcinomas. Recently, activation of the NPY Y5 receptor was shown to stimulate cell growth and increase migration in human breast cancer cells; however the effects of NPY have yet to be investigated in a murine model of breast cancer. Thus, the specific aims of the current study were to: (i) characterize NPY receptor expression in 4T1 breast cancer cells and orthotopic tumors grown in BALB/c mice and (ii) investigate the impact of NPY receptor activation on 4T1 cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Positive expression of NPY receptors (Y1R, Y2R and Y5R) was observed in cells and tumor tissue. As well, NPY treatment of 4T1 cells promoted a concentration-dependent increase in proliferation, through increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2. Using NPY receptor antagonists (Y1R:BIBP3226, Y2R:BIIE0246 and Y5R:L-152,804), we found the proliferative response to be Y5R mediated. Additionally, NPY increased chemotaxis through Y2R and Y5R activation. These data are in congruence with those from human cell lines and highlight the 4T1 cell line as a translatable model of breast cancer in which the effects of NPY can be studied in an immunocompetent system."

The experiments in vitro showed that 95-D cell viability was inhibited by various amounts of TBA and death was induced in a dose-dependent manner. The possible mechanism was that TBA can induce cell death by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; &Delta;&Psi;m) and increasing hydrogen peroxide(H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) level. These results imply that TBA efficiently induces death in 95-D lung cancer cells and that TBA exerts cytotoxicity on cancer cells by its pro-oxidative activity. &copy; (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland."

In this study, we have explored these data to advance computational approaches that enable more effective and targeted use of current and future anticancer therapeutics. Results: We modelled the 50% growth inhibition bioassay end-point (GI50) of 17,142 compounds screened against 59 cancer cell lines from the NCI60 panel (941,831 data-points, matrix 93.08% complete) by integrating the chemical and biological (cell line) information. We determine that the protein, gene transcript, and miRNA abundance provide the highest predictive signal when modelling the GI50 endpoint, which significantly outperformed the DNA copy-number variation or exome sequencing data (Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD), P < 0.05). We demonstrate that, within the limits of the data, our approach exhibits the ability to both interpolate and extrapolate compound bioactivities to new cell lines and tissues and, although to a lesser extent, to dissimilar compounds. Moreover, our approach outperforms previous models generated on the GDSC data set. Finally, we determine that in the cases investigated in more detail, the predicted drug-pathway associations and growth inhibition patterns are mostly consistent with the experimental data, which also suggests the possibility of identifying genomic markers of drug sensitivity for novel compounds on novel cell lines."

Using a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA, we show that tumor-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is necessary and sufficient to drive the development of Gr-1 + CD11b + cells that suppressed antigen-specific T cells. In vivo, abrogation of tumor-derived GM-CSF inhibited the recruitment of Gr-1 + CD11b + cells to the tumor microenvironment and blocked tumor development-a finding that was dependent on CD8 + T cells. In humans, PDA tumor cells prominently expressed GM-CSF in vivo.

Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) was applied to determine chromosomal differences between GLC4 and GLC4-MITO. Comparative genomic hybridisation analysis revealed gain of 2q, 6p, 9q, 13q, 14q, 15q, 19q and Xp and loss of 1p, 2q, 3p, 3q, 4q, 6q, 8q, 11p, 16p, 17q, 18p, 20p and Xq. In the over-represented chromosomal areas, seven transporter genes were identified: ABCB6, ABCB2 (TAP1), ABCB3 (TAP2), ABCF1 (ABC50), ABCC10 (MRP7), ABCA2 (ABC2) and ABCC4 (MRP4). No RNA or protein upregulation was observed for ABCB6, ABCF1, ABCC10, ABCC4, ABCB2 and ABCB3, but an increased expression was detected for ABCA2 mRNA in GLC4-MITO. ABCA2 is known to be involved in resistance to estramustine. In the MTT assay, GLC4-MITO was two-fold resistant to estramustine compared to GLC4. Coincubation with estramustine and mitoxantrone increased mitoxantrone accumulation in GLC4-MITO, while this was not affected in GLC4. This suggests that estramustine is able to block mitoxantrone efflux in GLC4-MITO cells. These data reveal that cellular reduction of mitoxantrone in a mitoxantrone-resistant cell line is associated with overexpression of ABCA2."

In this study, the antitumor effect of afatinib was investigated on the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The T24 bladder cancer cell line was treated with afatinib at various concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10 and 20 micromol/l). MTT assay was used to estimate the proliferation of the T24 cells; flow cytometric analysis was used to estimate the effect of afatinib on T24 cell apoptosis; cell invasion ability was assessed by a Transwell invasion assay; and western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The MTT assay demonstrated that afatinib inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the cell apoptosis rate increased as the concentration of afatinib increased. The cell invasion assay indicated that afatinib treatment significantly inhibited the invasive behavior of T24 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that with increasing afatinib concentrations, Bcl-2, phosphorylated (p)-ERK1/2, p-Akt, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels were significantly decreased, whereas total (t)-ERK1/2 and t-Akt expression levels remained basically unchanged, and Bax expression levels were greatly increased. The results indicate that afatinib inhibits the proliferation and invasion of T24 cells in vitro and induces the apoptosis of these cells by inhibiting the EGFR signaling network."

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess cytotoxicity. DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of safranal, and cell morphologic changes and apoptosis were determined by the normal inverted microscope, Annexin V, and propidium iodide, followed by flow cytometric analysis, respectively.\\n\\nRESULTS: MTT assay revealed a remarkable and concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect of safranal on PC-3 cells in comparison with non-malignant cell line. The morphologic alterations of the cells confirmed the MTT results. The IC50 values against PC-3 cells were found to be 13.0  0.07 and 6.4  0.09 \u03bcg/ml at 48 and 72 h, respectively. Safranal induced an early and late apoptosis in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells, indicating apoptosis is involved in this toxicity. DNA analysis revealed typical ladders as early as 48 and 72 h after treatment, indicative of apoptosis.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical study demonstrated a prostate cancer cell line to be highly sensitive to safranal-mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Although the molecular mechanisms of safranal action are not clearly understood, it appears to have potential as a therapeutic agent."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell survival was assayed in J82 cell line and the J82/MMC derivative after treating them with sequential ALA-mediated PDT and mitomycin C, and with the sequence of treatments reversed. Cell survival was estimated using the tetrazolium assay. The relative mitochondrial density of the two cell lines was estimated using flow cytometry to measure 123rhodamine fluorescence. RESULTS: The effect of sequential mitomycin C followed by ALA-mediated PDT enhanced the effect of PDT in both cell lines. In J82/MMC this effect was marginally supra-additive. When ALA-mediated PDT was administered before mitomycin C, the combined effect was 'sub-additive'. 123Rhodamine fluorescence was > 10 times greater in J82/MMC than J82, suggesting a significantly higher mitochondrial density in the former than the latter. CONCLUSION: Mitomycin C appears to enhance ALA-mediated PDT when administered first. This appears to be particularly so in J82/MMC. This phenomenon may have clinical significance in recurrent superficial bladder cancer."

Since MHCII may play an important role in the development of host antitumor immune response, we explored the possibility of restoring MHCII inducibility in several IFNg-resistant tumor cell lines using protein kinase C (PKC) agonists phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or Bryostatin. RESULTS: Tumor cells were co-cultured with various concentrations of PMA and IFNg for 48 hr. The expression of MHCII antigens and receptors IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 was determined by flow cytometry. We showed that the presence of as little as 0.1 ng/ml of PMA in tissue culture restored the ability of weakly inducible LS1034 colon carcinoma cells to express MHCII in response to IFNg (100 - 10,000 IU/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, Bryostatin 1, as low as 10 ng/ml produced a 5-6 fold upregulation of MHCII. The effect of PMA was not observed in two other poorly responding cell lines, MSTO-211H mesothelioma and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma, and was abrogated by relatively high concentrations of PKC inhibitors staurosporine (100 nM) and GF 109203X (1,000 nM). Both surface and intracellular staining of all cell lines with antibodies against IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 failed to detect any increase in IFNg receptor expression following incubation with PMA. CONCLUSION: In this study we showed that IFNg-inducibility of MHCII antigens in weakly inducible LS1034 colorectal carcinoma cell line can be rescued by concomitant incubation with PKC agonists. Bryostatin 1 may be considered for further investigation of IFNg-dependent MHCII induction in resistant tumors in vivo."

        "abstract": "Drug induced cell differentiation represents a promising experimental model for proteomic analysis of cancer cells. In fact, by modulating and monitoring neoplastic cell differentiation it could be possible to identify cytodifferentiation related protein expression changes that can be subsequently utilized in vivo as potential cancer biomarkers. One main advantage of this approach is the significant reduction of biological variability normally observed in clinical biomarker research, with important implications also in prognosis and therapy. At this regard, a new class of differentiating agents is emerging, the so called PPAR-ligands, which however are characterized by a debated mechanism of action that has not been yet studied through a proteomic approach. To this aim, we investigated ciglitazone-induced differentiation of a human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cell line, by monitoring biochemical and cellular parameters of cytodifferentiation and modifications of cellular protein profiles through 2-DE and MALDI-TOF analysis. Independent of the hypothesized mechanism of action of this intriguing PPARgamma agonist, results indicated that ciglitazone is a strong differentiating agent for the HepG2 cell line and that this process is associated with modifications of protein expression related to cell antioxidant systems, the cell cycle apparatus, signal transduction pathways, cellular stress and invasiveness. At last, considering these and other published data, a proteomic profile related to the cancer aggressiveness is beginning to emerge."

        "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a relatively effective therapeutic method for localized prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, radioresistance occurs in nearly 30% of patients treated with potentially curative doses. Therapeutic synergy between radiotherapy and androgen ablation treatment provides a promising strategy for improving the clinical outcome. Accordingly, the androgen deprivation-induced signaling pathway may also mediate radiosensitivity in PCa cells. The C4-2 cell line was derived from the androgen-sensitive LNCaP parent line under androgen-depleted condition and had acquired androgen-refractory characteristics. In our study, the response to radiation was evaluated in both LNCaP and C4\u20132. Results showed that C4-2 cells were more likely to survive from irradiation and appeared more aggressive in their resistance to radiation treatment compared with LNCaP, as measured by clonogenic assays and cell viability and cell cycle analyses. Gene expression analyses revealed that a set of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair were differentially regulated in LNCaP and C4-2 in response to radiation, which was also consistent with the radiation-resistant property observed in C4-2 cells. These results strongly suggested that the radiation-resistant property may develop with progression of PCa to androgen-independent status. Not only can the LNCaP and C4-2 PCa progression model be applied for investigating androgen-refractory progression, but it can also be used to explore the development of radiation resistance in PCa."

We identified the endothelial P2Y2 receptor, which is activated by ATP, as the primary mediator of this effect. Mice deficient in P2Y2 or lacking ATP secretion from platelets show strongly reduced tumor cell metastasis. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which platelets promote cancer cell metastasis and suggest the P2Y2 receptor and its endothelial downstream signaling mechanisms as a target for antimetastatic therapies. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Lewis\u00a0Y (LeY) antigen is an oligosaccharide that is highly expressed at the cell surface in various human cancers. Increased LeY expression activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and promotes cell proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing cells. However, the effect of downregulation of LeY expression on cell proliferation in HER2-overexpressing cells remains unknown. FUT1 encodes \u03b11,2-fucosyltransferase, a key enzyme for LeY synthesis. We knocked down FUT1 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in four HER2-overexpressing human cancer cell lines, including NCI-N87, MKN7, SKBr3 and BT474. We investigated whether downregulation of LeY and alteration in the glycosylation status of these cells affect cell proliferation and HER2 activation. Knocking down FUT1 expression markedly inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87, which highly expressed EGFR and was sensitive to EGFR deprivation. Furthermore, FUT1 siRNA downregulated the total amount of HER2 protein, phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in this cell line. Moreover, the marked downregulation of phosphorylation of HER2 and ERK was observed following short-time EGF-stimulation. These effects were not observed in the other three cell lines. Our results suggest that knockdown of FUT1 downregulates HER2 signaling via EGFR downregulation. FUT1 may serve as a new molecular target for HER2-overexpressing human cancers with activated EGFR signaling."

        "abstract": "The role of energy deregulation and altered/adapted metabolism in tumor cells is an increasingly important issue in understanding cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase (FH), followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs. The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy, mimicking the Warburg effect. Thus, there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation, as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers. Here, we describe a new immortalized cell line, UOK268, derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer. This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line, UOK262. We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation, p.His192Asp, and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268. The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein, which localized to the mitochondria, but with loss of almost all catalytic activity. The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux. Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray (hMitChip3) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways, such as lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and energy production/glycolysis. UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced, irreversible Warburg effect and, combined with UOK262, provides a unique in vitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer. ?? 2012."

The method is based on capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection and allows simultaneously probing multiple intracellular components in sister cells. To test the new technology, we compared the expression patterns of green fluorescent protein (GFP) between the sisters in cultured cancer cells stably transfected with a GFP-expressing construct. We found that all sister cells had detectable asymmetry in the GFP expression patterns with a confidence level of higher than 95%. To our best knowledge, this is the first reported observation of asymmetric patterns of protein expression in sister cells in a cancer cell line. The proposed technology can reliably detect minor differences in chemical contents between sister cells, which makes it a potentially indispensable tool in studying the molecular mechanisms of developmental processes. It will be especially valuable in quantitative studies of cells with complex proliferation kinetics (e.g., stem cells)."

        "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a DNA nick sensor involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancers. To extend this specific therapy to other types of carcinomas, a panel of 11 different cancer cells were screened in the present study. JF-305, a pancreatic cancer cell line of Chinese origin, demonstrated sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor 6(5H)-phenanthridinone. In the present study, 3 \u03bcM olaparib conferred a cell survival rate of 25% following four days of treatment. The colony formation efficiency was 83% at 10 nM, and dropped to 12% at 1 \u03bcM following seven days of treatment. Furthermore, olaparib induced cell cycle arrest in the S and G2/M phases prior to the initiation of apoptosis. Although the incidence of double-strand breaks (DSBs) was increased in the olaparib-treated JF-305 cells, the RAD51 foci were well formed at the sites of \u03b3-H2AX recruitment, indicating an activated HR mechanism. Furthermore, tumor growth was reduced by 49.8% following 22 days of consecutive administration of 10 mg/kg olaparib in the JF-305 xenograft mouse model. In summary, the JF-305 cell line was sensitive to olaparib and provided a prospective model for the preclinical assessment of PARP inhibitors in the therapy of pancreatic cancer."

Several human ABC transporters, such as ABCB1 and ABCC1, have been attributed to cause multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer treatment when over-expressed. In the past, an MDR cancer cell line MCF7/AdVp3000 has been selected, and overexpression of ABCG2 was thought to cause MDR in this cell line. However, ectopic overexpression of ABCG2 in MCF7 cells could not explain the high drug resistance level observed with the selected cell line. In this study, we designed an AmpArray analysis to profile whether other ABC transporters were also selected to contribute to the increased drug resistance in MCF7/AdVp3000 cells. We found that 16 ABC transporters, including ABCG2, had >/=1.5-fold altered expression in MCF7/AdVp3000 compared with the parental MCF7 cells. In particular, the expression of ABCA4 and ABCC3 was increased by 132- and 459-fold, respectively, whereas ABCG2 was increased by approximately 3000-fold. Furthermore, the elevated expression of these three transporters reversed with the reversed drug resistance phenotype, and silencing ABCC3 expression in MCF7/AdVp3000 cells significantly reduced doxorubicin resistance. Thus, other ABC transporters in addition to ABCG2 are likely to contribute to the MDR selected in MCF7/AdVp3000 cells. This study also shows that AmpArray can be used as a quick and easy tool to profile the expression of ABC transporters in resistant cell lines and tumor samples for potential use in individualized design of therapy."

Although much is known about both the cellular changes that lead to HCC and the etiological agents responsible for the majority of HCC cases, the molecule pathogenesis of HCC is still not well understood. We aimed to determine the effect of c-Myc gene expression on the proliferative, invasive, and migrative capabilities of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: A plasmid- based polymerase III promoter system was used to deliver and express short interfering RNA targeting c-Myc to reduce its expression in HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis was used to measure the protein level of c-Myc in HepG2 cells. The effects of c-Myc silencing on the invasion, motility, and proliferation of HepG2 cells were assessed using a Transwell chamber cell migration assay system and a growth curve assay, respectively.\\n\\nRESULTS: The data showed that plasmids expressing siRNA against c-Myc significantly decreased its expression in HepG2 cells by up to 85%. Importantly, pSilencer-c-Myc transfected cells showed a significantly reduced potential in migration, invasion, and proliferation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: C-Myc plays an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The data show that down-regulating the c-Myc protein level in HepG2 cells by RNAi could significantly inhibit migration, invasion and proliferation of HepG2 cells.

        "abstract": "Epigenetic drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) possess anticancer properties due to its ability to regulate genes associated with tumor growth, differentiation, apoptosis and metastasis. In addition to its apoptotic effect, phenylbutyrate (PB), a carboxylic acid HDACI, inhibited an anaplastic (ATC) thyroid cancer cell line ARO from penetrating a matrigel coated transwell with concomitant suppression of a metastasis-associated gene, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and stimulation of a transformation suppressor protein, reversion-inducing- cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs without affecting MMP-2 expression levels. Direct evidence suggesting MMP-7 down-regulated cancer metastasis came from the observation of a decreased pulmonary metastasis in SCID mice xeno-transplanted with MMP-7-knocked-down ARO cells. In addition, H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, remarkably restored the down-regulaed MMP-7 level treated by PB. Thus, the suppressive effect of PB on MMP-7 was partially carried out through H3 phosphoacetylation. To conclude, our findings suggest PB inhibits MMP-7 expression epigenetically through phosphoacetylation of histone proteins, and thereby, reduced invasive ability of an ATC thyroid cancer cell line."

        "abstract": "Estrogens produced within breast tumors may play a pivotal role in growth stimulation of the breast cancer cells. However, it is elusive whether the epithelial breast cancer cells themselves synthesize estrogens, or whether the surrounding tumor stromal cells synthesize and supply the cancer cells with estrogen. The aromatase enzyme catalyzes the estrogen production, aromatizing circulating androgens into estrogens. The aim of this study was to investigate aromatase expression and function in a model system of human breast cancer, using the estrogen responsive human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Cells were cultured in a low estrogen milieu and treated with estrogens, aromatizable androgens or non-aromatizable androgens. Cell proliferation, expression of estrogen-regulated proteins and aromatase activity were investigated. The MCF-7 cell line was observed to express sufficient aromatase enzyme activity in order to aromatize the androgen testosterone, resulting in a significant cell growth stimulation. The testosterone-mediated growth effect was completely inhibited by the aromatase inhibitors letrozole and 4-hydroxy-androstenedione. Expression studies of estrogen-regulated proteins confirmed that testosterone was aromatized to estrogen in the MCF-7 cells. Thus, the results indicate that epithelial breast cancer cells possess the ability to aromatize circulating androgens to estrogens."

Previous research has shown that fusion hybrids of human DCs and autologous tumor cells can induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against autologous tumor cells in animal models and human clinical trials. However, a major restriction factor for the clinical use is the difficulty for preparation of sufficient amount of autologous tumor cells especially for the patients with metastasis cancer whose primary tumor lesion is not clear or has been resected. In this study, allogeneic breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cells were electrofused to autologous DCs from patient with breast cancer as a strategy to deliver shared breast cancer antigens to DCs. Fusion cells generated by autologous DCs and allogeneic MCF-7 were able to induce autologous T lymphocytes proliferation, high levels of IFN-gamma production and CTL responses. CTLs induced by DCs/allogeneic MCF-7 fusion cells were able to kill autologous breast cancer cells in an antigen specific and HLA restriction manner. Our study may provide the experiment basis for the use of allogeneic breast cancer cell line in the DC/tumor cell fusion cell vaccination strategy."

        "abstract": "Constitutive NF-\u03baB signaling promotes survival in multiple myeloma (MM) and other cancers; however, current NF-\u03baB-targeting strategies lack cancer cell specificity. Here, we identify the interaction between the NF-\u03baB-regulated antiapoptotic factor GADD45\u03b2 and the JNK kinase MKK7 as a therapeutic target in MM. Using a drug-discovery strategy, we developed DTP3, a D-tripeptide, which disrupts the GADD45\u03b2/MKK7 complex, kills MM cells effectively, and, importantly, lacks toxicity to normal cells. DTP3 has similar anticancer potency to the clinical standard, bortezomib, but more than 100-fold higher cancer cell specificity invitro. Notably, DTP3 ablates myeloma xenografts in mice with no apparent side effects at the effective doses. Hence, cancer-selective targeting of the NF-\u03baB pathway is possible and, at least for myeloma patients, promises a profound benefit."

Pulse-chase experiments were performed in the NIH:OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell line with [(35)S]Met/Cys radiolabeling. After pulsing the cells with radioisotope for 30 min and analyzing cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-CA 125 antibodies, a doublet species (form B, approximately 400 kD) and a ladder of slower-moving components were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. After a 4-hour chase period, a much larger species (form A) became evident. With further culture, the B form disappeared and the A form accumulated, suggesting a 'precursor-product' relationship between the two forms. The putative precursor species did not appear in the culture supernatant, but secretion of the mature species (form A) began after about 1 h of synthesis. Lectin-binding experiments demonstrated that the B form is a glycoprotein and not an early apomucin precursor. In contrast to other reports, no smaller species of the mature form of CA 125 were detected in this study. Trypsin digestion severely degraded the antigen but discrete smaller fragments were not formed. CA 125 antigen is synthesized through a glycosylated 400-kD precursor species. The mature form of the antigen appears in the cell after about 1 h of synthesis and in the culture medium after 1-4 h."

Members of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins including EZH2, a PRC2 component, are upregulated in various cancer types, implicating their role in tumorigenesis. Here, we have identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) that are repressed by EZH2. These miRNAs, in turn, regulate the expression of PRC1 proteins BMI1 and RING2. We found that ectopic overexpression of EZH2-regulated miRNAs attenuated cancer cell growth and invasiveness, and abrogated cancer stem cell properties. Importantly, expression analysis revealed an inverse correlation between miRNA and PRC protein levels in cell culture and prostate cancer tissues. Taken together, our data have uncovered a coordinate regulation of PRC1 and PRC2 activities that is mediated by miRNAs. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

At the same time, many AEDs alter endocrine function with phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB) causing-reduced free fractions of sex-steroid hormones, while VPA induces hyperandrogenism. Changes in sex-steroid hormone levels are known to affect apoptosis in endocrine tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the antiepileptic drugs PHT, PB, VPA and lamotrigine (LTG) on estrogen-stimulated cell growth of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and to evaluate whether this effect could be related to a direct estrogen receptor (ER) binding. VPA reduced cell growth at therapeutically relevant concentrations; half-maximum effect of VPA on cell growth was 230 microM. PHT (100 microM) and PB (10 microM) reduced cell growth by 47 and 21%, respectively. None of the drugs had affinity to isolated estrogen receptors, and excess of estrogen was not able to abolish the growth inhibition provoked by VPA. However, sub-therapeutic concentrations of VPA (100 microM) mimicked estrogen by inducing cell growth (11%) in an estrogen-depleted medium, an effect that was abolished by adding an estrogen receptor antagonist. In conclusion; the estrogen receptor appear to be indirectly activated by sub-therapeutic concentrations of VPA, but therapeutic concentrations of VPA inhibits cell growth by mechanisms that do not seem to involve the estrogen receptor or estrogen stimulation."

Recently, published studies suggest that klotho can also serve as a potential tumor suppressor. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of klotho in human lung cancer cell line A549.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this study, plasmids encoding klotho or klotho specific shRNAs were constructed to overexpress or knockdown klotho in vitro. A549 cells were respectively treated with pCMV6-MYC-KL or klotho specific shRNAs. The MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of klotho and flow cytometry was utilized to observe and detect the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by klotho. The activation of IGF-1/insulin signal pathways in A549 cells treated by pCMV6-MYC-KL or shRNAs were evaluated by western blotting. The expression levels of bcl-2 and bax transcripts were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\\n\\nRESULTS: Overexpression of klotho reduced the proliferation of lung cancer A549 cells, whereas klotho silencing in A549 cells enhanced proliferation. Klotho did not show any effects on HEK-293 cells. Klotho overexpression in A549 cells was associated with reduced IGF-1/insulin-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R (IGF-1 receptor)/IR (insulin receptor) (P < 0.01). Overexpression of klotho can promote the apoptosis of A549 cells (P < 0.01). Overexpression of klotho, a bcl family gene bax, was found up-regulated and bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis gene, was found down-regulated (P < 0.01). In contrast, bax and bcl-2 were found down-regulated (P < 0.05) and up-regulated (P < 0.01), respectively when silencing klotho using shRNAs.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Klotho can inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of A549 cells, this may be partly due to the inhibition of IGF-1/insulin pathways and involving regulating the expression of the apoptosis-related genes bax/bcl-2. Thus, klotho can serve as a potential tumor suppressor in A549 cells."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is a global health concern and is a major cause of death among women. In Oman, it is the most common cancer in women, with an incidence rate of 15.6 per 100,000 Omani females. Various anticancer remedies have been discovered from natural products in the past and the search is continuing for additional examples. Cytotoxic natural compounds may have a major role in cancer therapy either in potentiating the effect of chemotherapy or reducing its harmful effects. Recently, a few studies have reported advantages of using crude camel milk in treating some forms of cancer. However, no adequate data are available on the lyophilised camel's milk responsibility for triggering apoptosis and oxidative stress associated with human breast cancer. The present study aimed to address the role of the lyophilised camel's milk in inducing proliferation repression of BT-474 and HEp-2 cells compared with the non-cancer HCC1937 BL cell line. Lyophilized camel's milk fundamentally repressed BT-474 cells growth and proliferation through the initiation of either the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways as indicated by both caspase-3 mRNA and its action level, and induction of death receptors in BT-474 but not the HEp-2 cell line. In addition, lyophilised camel's milk enhanced the expression of oxidative stress markers, heme-oxygenase-1 and reactive oxygen species production in BT-474 cells. Increase in caspase-3 mRNA levels by the lyophilised camel's milk was completely prevented by the actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor. This suggests that lyophilized camel's milk increased newly synthesized RNA. Interestingly,it significantly (p<0.003) repressed the growth of HEp-2 cells and BT-474 cells after treatment for 72 hours while 24 hours treatment repressed BT-474 cells alone. This finding suggests that the lyophilised camel's milk might instigate apoptosis through initiation of an alternative apoptotic pathway."

Hydroalcoholic extraction and adsorption separation processes (with Amberlite XAD16 resin) were used to produce natural extracts from residues of Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia robusta and their antiproliferative effect was evaluated in human colon carcinoma HT29 cell line. Our results showed that the natural extracts efficiently inhibited cancer cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest in different checkpoints-G1, G2/M and S. The phytochemical constituents presented in the samples, namely betacyanins, flavonoids (isorhamnetin derivatives) and phenolic acids (ferulic acid) were identified as the main responsible compounds for the cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the extracts that presented the lowest effective dose values in terms of polyphenols (ED50 value. <. 0.5. mg.

        "abstract": "By integrating growth pathways on which cancer cells rely, steroid receptor coactivators (SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3) represent emerging targets in cancer therapeutics. High-throughput screening for SRC small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) uncovered MCB-613 as a potent SRC small molecule \"stimulator\" (SMS). We demonstrate that MCB-613 can super-stimulate SRCs' transcriptional activity. Further investigation revealed that MCB-613 increases SRCs' interactions with other coactivators and markedly induces ER stress coupled to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because cancer cells overexpress SRCs and rely on them for growth, we show that we can exploit MCB-613 to selectively induce excessive stress in cancer cells. This suggests that over-stimulating the SRC oncogenic program can be an effective strategy to kill cancer cells. Wang et al. identify MCB-613 as a potent steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) small molecule stimulator. They show that, paradoxically, acute super-activation of SRCs specifically and effectively kills cancer cells by inducing aberrant cellular stress, suggesting an alternative strategy against cancer."

In the present study, diallyl disulfide [DADS], oil soluble organosulfur compound of garlic, was studied for its antiproliferative and induction of cell cycle arrest on prostate cancer cells in vitro. The suppression of cell growth was assessed by MTT assay. Induction of cell cycle arrest was assessed and confirmed by propidium iodide staining in flowcytometric analysis and western blotting analysis of major cell cycle regulator proteins. The results showed that DADS inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells in a dose dependent manner, compared to the control. At 25 microM and 40 microM concentrations, DADS induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition in PC-3 cells. Western blotting analysis of cyclin A, B(1) and cyclin dependent kinase 1 [CDK1] revealed that DADS inhibited the cell cycle by downregulating CDK1 expression. It is concluded that DADS, inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells through cell cycle arrest. Dose dependent effect of DADS on PC-3 cell line was observed in the present study."

In this study, we investigated the induction of chemokines (interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) by Fas antigen (Ag)-stimulation in a human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1. METHODS: The chemokine secretion was evaluated by using an ELISA and a northern blot, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) was assessed by using an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: The Fas antigen (Ag) stimulation clearly induced an increase in IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion in PANC-1 cells. This effect was also observed at the mRNA level. The induction of chemokine secretion by Fas Ag stimulation required de novo gene expression and protein synthesis. The pretreatment with interferon (IFN)-gamma markedly enhanced the effects of Fas Ag stimulation; IFN-gamma pretreatment and Fas Ag stimulation synergistically induced not only apoptosis but also IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that IFN-gamma significantly enhanced Fas Ag expression. In addition, Fas Ag stimulation actually evoked NF-kappa B activation in this cell line. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Fas Ag stimulation can induce chemokine secretion in PANC-1 cells, suggesting the contribution of Fas stimulation to the accumulation of immune cells in pancreatic cancer tissue."

We investigated the effect of an NE allograft (NE-10) and its cell line, NE-CS, which were established from the prostate of the LPB-Tag 12T-10 transgenic mouse, on human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. METHODS: The proliferation and pulmonary metastasis of LNCaP xenografts in athymic mice with and without NE-10 allografts were evaluated. Boyden chamber assay and microarray analysis were performed to investigate changes in invasion/migration and mRNA of LNCaP cells under the influence of the NE cells, respectively. RESULTS: NE-10 did not influence the proliferation of LNCaP. The pulmonary metastasis of LNCaP with NE-10 significantly increased compared to mice without it. The NE-CS cells accelerated the in vitro invasion/migration of adenocarcinoma cells. Increased expression of mRNA of gelsolin was observed in LNCaP cells incubated with the supernatant of NE-CS cells. CONCLUSIONS: The NE-10 allograft promotes pulmonary metastasis of subcutaneously inoculated LNCaP cells by facilitating cell invasion. Secretions from NE cells upregulate the expression of gelsolin, which is an actin-binding protein, resulting in acceleration of the migration of LNCaP cells."

A total number of 28 proteins differentially expressed were identified, and then the differential expression levels of partially identified proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis and/or real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, the association of PKM2 and HSPD1, two differentially expressed proteins, with MDR were analyzed, and the results showed that they could contribute considerably to the cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cell. The differential expression proteins could be classified into eight categories based on their functions, that is, calcium binding proteins, chaperones, extracellular matrix, proteins involved in drug detoxification or repair of DNA damage, metabolic enzymes, transcription factor, proteins related to cellular structure and proteins relative to signal transduction. These data will be valuable for further study of the mechanisms of MDR in the ovarian cancer."

        "abstract": "Membrane and membrane-associated proteins are rich in known or potential pharmaceutical drug targets for carcinogenesis. In order to systemically analyze membrane proteins of human breast cancer, we isolated membrane from MCF-7 cells by sequential extraction by washing with three different buffers, namely, phosphate buffer (5\u2009mM, pH 8.0), Tris (40\u2009mM, pH 9.5), and sodium carbonate (100\u2009mM pH 11). The extracted proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) using cup-loading and were then analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). A total of 137 spots from the gels of the three procedures were successfully identified. They corresponded to 79 distinct proteins. Among them, 22 exclusive proteins belonging to each washing procedure were also found, including P-glycoprotein, endoplasmin, Stress-70 protein, ADAM 10, protein disulfide isomerase, and glutamate receptor. These results indicate phosphate buffer to be the most beneficial for enrichment of peripheral membrane proteins, and sodium carbonate is beneficial for the presentation of integral membrane proteins but usually with poor resolution. The reference maps and identified proteins will serve as a basis for the further investigation of breast cancer, especially the proteomic comparison among different cell types of breast cancer, or among the different stages in the drug interfering process of the MCF-7 cell line.

        "abstract": "In our study, we show that expression of HPV-16 E6 sensitizes TNF-induced cytotoxicity of human ovarian cancer cell line A2780. This effect is not related to a different number of TNF receptors present on cell membrane. The major induction of massive apoptosis induced by TNF is not p53- and p21(waf-1)-dependent but it is principally related to NF-kappaB inhibition in A2780/E6 cells. Consistently to NF-kappaB inhibition a rapidly release of cytochrome c and severe induction of DNA fragmentation are seen in A2780/E6 cells. Also in human colon cancer cell line HCT-116/E6 the expression of HPV-16 E6 enhances TNF-cytotoxicity. This effect is not present in the HCT-116/mu-p53 clone (transfected with a dominant-negative mutated p53 transgene). Thus, taken together all these observations suggest that HPV-16 E6 sensitizes A2780 and HCT-116 cells to TNF; this effect is not p53-dependent, but it is essentially mediated through an inhibition in activating NF-kappaB activities."

METHODS: MSCs from umbilical cord were mixed with cervical cancer cell line HeLa cells and subcutaneously plated in armpit area of nude mice to examine the in vivo tumor growth. Micro-vessel density (MVD) in tumor tissue was examined by CD34 immunohistochemical staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were employed to detect the expression of proangiogenesis factors. RESULTS: MSC could effectively promote the cervical cancer growth in vivo as compared with controls (P<0.05). The immunohistochemical results of CD34 staining showed that MVD of cervical cancer was higher in MSC group than that in control group (P<0.05). And there was a higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in MSC than controls. CONCLUSION: MSC promotes the in vivo angiogenesis of cervical cancer cell line by VEGF production."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, most notably caused by mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, are sensitive to PARP inhibition. Microsatellite instability (MSI) accounts for 10-15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) and is hypothesized to lead to HR defects due to altered expression of Mre11, a protein required for double strand break (DSB) repair. Indeed, others have reported that PARP inhibition is efficacious in MSI CRC.\\n\\nMETHODS: Here we examine the response to niraparib, a potent PARP-1/PARP-2 inhibitor currently under clinical evaluation, in MSI versus microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. We compiled a large panel of MSI and MSS CRC cell lines and evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of niraparib. In addition to testing single agent cytotoxic activity of niraparib, we also tested irinotecan (or SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan) activity alone and in combination with niraparib in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nRESULTS: In contrast to earlier reports, MSI CRC cell lines were not more sensitive to niraparib than MSS CRC cell lines\u00b8 suggesting that the MSI phenotype does not sensitize CRC cell lines to PARP inhibition. Moreover, even the most sensitive MSI cell lines had niraparib EC50s greater than 10 fold higher than BRCA-deficient cell lines. However, MSI lines were more sensitive to SN-38 than MSS lines, consistent with previous findings. We have also demonstrated that combination of niraparib and irinotecan was more efficacious than either agent alone in both MSI and MSS cell lines both in vitro and in vivo, and that niraparib potentiates the effect of irinotecan regardless of MSI status.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results support the clinical evaluation of this combination in all CRC patients, regardless of MSI status."

        "abstract": "In breast carcinomas, increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) can act as a mitogen to augment tumorigenesis through the regulation of MAPK and AKT signaling pathways. Signaling through these two pathways allows IGF-1 to employ mechanisms that favor proliferation and cellular survival. Here we demonstrate a subset of previously described tumor suppressor and oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) that are under the direct regulation of IGF-1 signaling. Additionally, we show that the selective inhibition of either the MAPK or AKT pathways prior to IGF-1 stimulation prevents the expression of previously described tumor suppressor miRNAs that are family and cluster specific. Here we have defined, for the first time, specific miRNAs under the direct regulation of IGF-1 signaling in the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and demonstrate kinase signaling as a modulator of expression for a small subset of microRNAs. Taken together, these data give new insights into mechanisms governing IGF-1 signaling in breast cancer."

Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses characterizing the pigment as a partially saturated canthaxanthin, containing beta-ionone end rings, suggested its application as a retinoid. When tested for this property in retinoic acid receptor expressing prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, the fungal partially saturated canthaxanthin induced apoptosis. Low apoptosis percentage in DU145 prostrate cancer cells that does not express functional retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR-beta) suggested binding specificity of the partially saturated canthaxanthin for RAR-beta."

METHODS: There were 3 groups, i.e. experimental group HCC1937 with lentivirus -p21(waf1)-shRNA-RFP, control group 1 HCC1937 without lentivirus and control group 2 HCC1937 with lentivirus -RFP. The p21(waf1) and bim mRNA and protein expressions were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot respectively. And apoptosis of HCC1937 in different groups was assayed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated C-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: After interference with lentivirus-p21(waf1)-shRNA-RFP, p21(waf1) mRNA and protein expressions declined significantly in the experimental group versus the control groups (experiment group: 0.260 +/- 0.004, 0.293 +/- 0.006, control group 1: 0.879 +/- 0.028, 0.483 +/- 0.071, control group 2: 0.870 +/- 0.025, 0.469 +/- 0.047, all P < 0.01). The bim mRNA and protein expressions increased.

We found that miR-135a/b were downregulated while MCL1 was upregulated in A549/CDDP (cisplatin) cells, compared with the parental A549 cells. In vitro drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR-135a/b sensitized A549/CDDP cells to cisplatin. The luciferase activity of MCL1 3'-untranslated region-based reporter constructed in A549/CDDP cells suggested that MCL1 was the direct target gene of miR-135a/b. Enforced miR-135a/b expression reduced MCL1 protein level and sensitized A549/CDDP cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings first suggested that hsa-miR-135a/b could play a role in the development of CDDP resistance in lung cancer cell line at least in part by modulation of apoptosis via targeting MCL1."

In results of MDR development during chemotherapy cancer cells become resistant to further treatment. Microarray techniques can provide information about MDR development at gene expression level. ABC and SLC transporters are most important proteins responsible for this phenomenon. In this study changes of ABC and SLC genes expression pattern in drugs resistant sublines of the A2780 ovarian cancer cell line were demonstrated. The cytostatic resistant sublines were generated by culture of A2780 cell line with an increasing concentration of the indicated drugs. As screening methods, we used Affymetrix U219 Human Genome microarrays. Independent t-tests were used to determinate statistical significances of results. Genes that expression levels were higher than assumed threshold (upregulated above threefold and downregulated under -3 fold) were visualized using scatter plot method, selected and listed in table. Between the ABC genes increased expression of seven genes and decreased expression of three genes were observed. Expression of two genes was increased or decreased depending on the cell line. We observed significant (more than tenfold) increase in expression of four ABC genes: ABCA8, ABCB1, ABCB4 and ABCG2 and decreased expression of ABCA3 gene. We also observed changes in expression of 32 SLC genes. Between them we observe increased expression of 17 genes and decreased expression of 15 genes. Expression of four genes was increased or decreased dependent on cell line. The expression of nine SLC genes increased or decreased very significantly (more than tenfold). Five genes were significantly upregulated: SLC2A9, SLC16A3, SLC16A14, SLC38A4 and SLC39A8. Four additional genes were significantly downregulated: SLC2A14, SLC6A15, SLC8A1 and SLC27A2. Expression profiles of these genes give strong arguments for assumption of correlation between expression of ABC and SLC genes and drug resistance phenomenon. Identifying correlations between specific drug transporters and cytostatic drug resistance will require further investigation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS."

A confocal fluorescent microscopic observation revealed that the insertion of NES minimized the nuclear expression of Cx26, and increased its cytoplasmic expression, including plasma membrane junctions. Total cell counting and BrdUrd-labeling experiments showed that the growth of the breast cancer cells was inhibited by 74% upon transfection of Cx26-NES, whereas only 9% inhibition was observed with only Cx26 cDNA."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MLL2, an epigenetic regulator in mammalian cells, mediates histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) through the formation of a multiprotein complex. MLL2 shares a high degree of structural similarity with MLL, which is frequently disrupted in leukemias via chromosomal translocations. However, this structural similarity is not accompanied by functional equivalence. In light of this difference, and previous reports on involvement of epigenetic regulators in malignancies, we investigated MLL2 expression in established cell lines from breast and colon tissues. We then investigated MLL2 in solid tumors of breast and colon by immunohistochemistry, and evaluated potential associations with established clinicopathologic variables.\\n\\nRESULTS: We examined MLL2 at both transcript and protein levels in established cell lines from breast and colon cancers. Examination of these cell lines showed elevated levels of MLL2. Furthermore, we also identified incomplete proteolytic cleavage of MLL2 in the highly invasive tumor cell lines. To corroborate these results, we studied tumor tissues from patients by immunohistochemistry. Patient samples also revealed increased levels of MLL2 protein in invasive carcinomas of the breast and colon. In breast, cytoplasmic MLL2 was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent benign epithelium (p < 0.05), and in colon, both nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent benign mucosa (p < 0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our study indicates that elevated levels of MLL2 in the breast and colon cells are associated with malignancy in these tissues, in contrast to MLL involvement in haematopoietic cancer. In addition, both abnormal cellular localization of MLL2 and incomplete proteolytic processing may be associated with tumor growth/progression in breast and colonic tissues. This involvement of MLL2 in malignancy may be another example of the role of epigenetic regulators in cancer."

Most of the studies that have assigned a proapoptotic role to the FHIT gene were performed in adenoviral-FHIT-transduced cancer cells expressing high levels of the Fhit protein. The present work was the first study designed to investigate the effects of FHIT gene replacement in a human FHIT-negative non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line (Calu-1) by using a hormone-inducible expression system that allows tight modulation of the transgene expression. Through this approach, we demonstrated that a prolonged induction was required to accumulate the Fhit protein at levels adequate to promote a significant decrease of cell proliferation. Analysis of cell-cycle phase distribution showed an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase and a concomitant decrease in the S phase. Moreover, an upregulation of p21waf1 transcript was found, which could account for the alteration of the cycling properties of the cells. The growth-inhibitory effects observed were not associated with apoptosis appearance, and although in these conditions the Fhit protein content was higher than in normal bronchial human epithelial cells (NHBE), it was still significantly lower than the level capable of inducing apoptosis in Calu-1 cells after adenoviral-mediated FHIT gene transfer. These results indicate that the tumour suppressor properties of Fhit are strictly related to its expression level and show that the Fhit protein has a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on the Fhit-negative Calu-1 lung cancer cell line."

Similar results were acquired for cells transfected with Snail cDNA. Furthermore, downregulation of Snail by siRNA attenuated HRG-\u03b21 induced EMT-like phenotype. Inhibition of Akt kinase activation by a PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or exogenous expression of a kinase-dead mutant of Akt abrogated the increase of Snail expression induced by HRG-\u03b21. Conversely, expression of a constitutively active Akt resulted in increase of Snail expression. These results indicated that Snail upregulation by HRG-\u03b21 is mediated via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and that Snail plays a key role in HRG-\u03b21 induced breast cancer cell metastasis through induction of EMT. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Increased serum levels of both IL-18 and transferrin in cancer patients are correlated with its malignancy. However, the relationship between transferrin and IL-18 is not well understood. Here, we show that exogenous transferrin enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation and the proliferation rate was reduced when endogenous transferrin expression was inhibited by transferrin siRNA. The expression of endogenous transferrin was found to be regulated by IL-18. Furthermore, we found that the MAPK pathway is involved in IL-18-induced transferrin production. In conclusion, IL-18 is suggested as an inducer of endogenous transferrin expression in breast cancer cells."

Such drug sensitivity data for cancer cell lines provide suggestive treatments for different types and subtypes of cancer. Visualization of these datasets can reveal patterns that may not be obvious by examining the data without such efforts. Here we introduce Drug/Cell-line Browser (DCB), an online interactive HTML5 data visualization tool for interacting with three of the recently published datasets of cancer cell lines/drug-viability studies. DCB uses clustering and canvas visualization of the drugs and the cell lines, as well as a bar graph that summarizes drug effectiveness for the tissue of origin or the cancer subtypes for single or multiple drugs. DCB can help in understanding drug response patterns and prioritizing drug/cancer cell line interactions by tissue of origin or cancer subtype.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DCB is an open source Web-based tool that is freely available at: http://www.maayanlab.net/LINCS/DCB CONTACT: avi.maayan@mssm.edu\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) cells are a key feature of cancer inflammation in PDA, but remain poorly understood. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA, we show that tumor-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is necessary and sufficient to drive the development of Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) cells that suppressed antigen-specific T cells. In vivo, abrogation of tumor-derived GM-CSF inhibited the recruitment of Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) cells to the tumor microenvironment and blocked tumor development-a finding that was dependent on CD8(+) T cells. In humans, PDA tumor cells prominently expressed GM-CSF in vivo. Thus, tumor-derived GM-CSF is an important regulator of inflammation and immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment."

The aim of this study is to explore the methylation profile difference in different metastatic potential cell lines. METHODS: To compare the DNA methylation profile of two large cell lung cancer cell lines with different metastatic potential by MeIP chip hybridization, hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes of L9981 cell lines were analyzed online in NIH-DAVID, KEGG and MILANO webside. RESULTS: Compared with NL9980 cell line, 735 genes are hypermethylated in L9981, including 656 known genes and 79 unknown genes; 809 gene are hypermethylated in L9981, including 698 known genes and 111 unknown genes; the different genes are involved in cell process, signal transduction, cell communication, cell adhesion, cell motility, and angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of suppressor genes and negative regulator of signal transduction and hopomethylation of oncogene and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in L9981 may promote metastasis of tumor cells."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in China. Mutation analysis reveals that LKB1 inactivation is present in 30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), indicating its role as a tumor suppressor. However, the molecular mechanism is still not clear. Our study attempted to establish LKB1 stable knockdown NSCLC cell line, detect alterations in gene expression and identify the genes regulated by LKB1. METHODS: LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cell line was established using a lentiviral short hairpin RNA. To identify the knockdown effect, LKB1 mRNA and protein expression level were evaluated with quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. We treated the cell lines with 2-deoxyglucose to determine if LKB1 protein function was impacted. Gene microarray analysis was performed to detect the gene expression alterations in LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cells. RESULTS: LKB1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly suppressed in LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cell line. 2-DG treatment had little impact on the phosphorylation of AMPK, which is the downstream target of LKB1, indicating the loss of function of LKB1. The microarray data showed that LKB1 knockdown resulted in expression alterations of 1243 kinds of genes, including those involved in cell migration, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cell line provides us with a great tool to investigate various genes regulated by LKB1 through microarray. The discovery of cell proliferation and migration-related genes regulated by LKB1 is critical for unraveling molecular mechanisms of LKB1's role in the development and metastasis of lung cancer."

        "abstract": "KLF5 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in multiple physical and pathological processes, including cell growth, cell cycle regulation, and angiogenesis. To better characterize KLF5 function in bladder carcinogenesis, we established stable TSU-Pr1 cell clones expressing different levels of KLF5. These clones were then characterized for cell growth, cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, and alteration in gene expression. Overexpression of KLF5 promoted tumorigenesis of the TSU-Pr1 cancer cells in mice. Consistently, KLF5 increased G1 to S phase transition, which was accompanied by the upregulation of cyclin D1, phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt, and reduced protein levels for CDK inhibitors p27 and p15. Microarray analysis combined with expression verification in different cell systems identified a number of additional genes that are potentially regulated by KLF5, including HBP17, ITGA6, and RAIG1. These findings suggest that the KLF5 transcription factor plays an oncogenic role in the TSU-Pr1 bladder cancer cell line through the regulation of a subset of genes."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Taxol (generic name paclitaxel), a plant-derived antineoplastic agent, used widely against breast, ovarian and lung cancer, was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia. The limited supply of the drug has prompted efforts to find alternative sources, such as chemical synthesis, tissue and cell cultures of the Taxus species both of which are expensive and yield low levels. Fermentation processes with microorganisms would be the methods of choice to lower the costs and increase yields. Previously we have reported that F. solani isolated from T. celebica produced taxol and its precursor baccatin III in liquid grown cultures J Biosci 33:259-67, 2008. This study was performed to evaluate the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of cancer cell lines by the fungal taxol and fungal baccatin III of F. solani isolated from T. celebica.\\n\\nMETHODS: Cell lines such as HeLa, HepG2, Jurkat, Ovcar3 and T47D were cultured individually and treated with fungal taxol, baccatin III with or without caspase inhibitors according to experimental requirements. Their efficacy on apoptotic induction was examined.\\n\\nRESULTS: Both fungal taxol and baccatin III inhibited cell proliferation of a number of cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 0.005 to 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM for fungal taxol and 2 to 5\u00a0\u03bcM for fungal baccatin III. They also induced apoptosis in JR4-Jurkat cells with a possible involvement of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, and was unaffected by inhibitors of caspase-9,-2 or -3 but was prevented in presence of caspase-10 inhibitor. DNA fragmentation was also observed in cells treated with fungal taxol and baccatin III.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic activity exhibited by fungal taxol and baccatin III involves the same mechanism, dependent on caspase-10 and membrane potential loss of mitochondria, with taxol having far greater cytotoxic potential."

In this study, we screened 24 human breast cancer cell lines and three immortalized human breast epithelial cell lines for alterations in {beta}- and {gamma}-catenin and APC by western blotting, protein truncation assay and DNA sequence analysis. In one cell line (DU 4475), an APC mutation was identified (E1577stop) that resulted in expression of truncated APC. This mutation was associated with elevated cytosolic {beta}-catenin levels, probably due to loss of APC function, as in colon cancers. No mutations were found in exon 3 of the {beta}- or {gamma}-catenin genes. We conclude that APC mutations and {beta}-catenin upregulation may occur with low frequency in human breast cancer cells."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: FRZB (frizzled motif associated with bone development), a member of the secreted frizzled related protein (sFRP) family, plays an important role in embryonic development. The expression of FRZB can suppress the invasion ability of prostate cancer by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. This study was to investigate the effects of FRZB on tumorigenicity and metastasis of gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901. METHODS: FRZB expression vector and empty vector were constructed and transfected into SGC-7901 cells to obtain stable clones (SGC-7901/FRZB and SGC-7901/vector). Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. The tumorigenicity was investigated by soft agar colony formation test (in vitro) and xenograft mouse model (in vivo). The adhesive and invasive abilities of SGC-7901/FRZB cells were determined by Boyden chambers. The expression of MMPs in SGC-7901 cells was tested by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The expression of FRZB was increased in SGC-7901/FRZB cells. Growth rate and colony formation rate of SGC-7901/FRZB cells were decreased to about 60% and 15% as compared with those of SGC-7901/vector cells, respectively. The rates of adhesion to collagenI, collagen IV, vitronectin, fibronectin and laminin were increased in SGC-7901/FRZB cells by 12.8%, 19.8%, 59.8%, 26.7% and 15.2% as compared with those in SGC-7901/vector cells, respectively. The positive dyeing of MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9 in SGC-7901/FRZB cells was reduced. The numbers of invasive SGC-7901, SGC-7901/vector and SGC-7901/FRZB cells were 55.90+/-5.68, 54.80+/-6.97, 6.60+/-2.63, respectively. CONCLUSION: FRZB exhibits antitumor ability in gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 in vitro and in vivo, and decreases the expression of MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gene encoding integrator complex subunit 6 (INTS6), previously known as deleted in cancer cells 1 (DICE1, OMIM 604331) was found to be frequently affected by allelic deletion and promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer specimens and cell lines. A missense mutation has been detected in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Together, these results suggest INTS6/DICE1 as a putative tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the growth inhibitory effects of INTS6/DICE1 on prostate cancer cells. RESULTS: Markedly decreased INTS6/DICE1 mRNA levels were detected in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 as well as CPTX1532 as compared to a cell line derived from normal prostate tissue, NPTX1532. Exogenous re-expression of INTS6/DICE1 cDNA in androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 cell lines substantially suppressed their ability to form colonies in vitro. This growth inhibition was not due to immediate induction of apoptosis. Rather, prostate cancer cells arrested in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Expression profiling of members of the Wnt signaling pathway revealed up-regulation of several genes including disheveled inhibitor CXXC finger 4 (CXXC4), frizzled homologue 7 (FZD7), transcription factor 7-like 1 (TCF7L1), and down-regulation of cyclin D1. CONCLUSION: These results show for the first time a link between INTS6/DICE1 function, cell cycle regulation and cell-cell communication involving members of the Wnt signaling pathway."

        "abstract": "Cell-swelling, induced by a hyposmotic challenge, stimulated the efflux of L-carnitine from a human mammary cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. The response was dependent upon the extent of the osmotic shock. Hyposmotically-activated L-carnitine efflux was inhibited by the anion transport blocker diiodosalicylate. The efflux of taurine from MDA-MB-231 cells was also stimulated by a hyposmotic shock via a pathway sensitive to diiodosalicylate. L-carnitine efflux from MDA-MB-231 cells was stimulated by isosmotic swelling in a manner which was inhibited by diiodosalicylate. The results suggest that L-carnitine may exit cells via a volume-sensitive pathway: it is possible that L-carnitine efflux may utilize the same pathway as amino acids. The efflux of L-carnitine via this route could have a major effect on the intracellular concentration of L-carnitine and could facilitate transepithelial L-carnitine transport."

We argue for combinatorial strategies with agents that target tumor cells to release these antigens together with innovative therapies that enhance immunological responses by interfering with inhibitory checkpoints. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 is one of the major inflammatory cytokines, the effects of various dietary flavonoids on TNF-\u03b1 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated J774.1 cells were evaluated in vitro. Flavones, flavonols, and chalcone are the most potent inhibitors of production of TNF-\u03b1. Flavanone, naringenin, anthocyanidin, pelargodinin, and cyanidin exhibit moderate inhibitory activity. In contrast, genistein isoflavone displays weak inhibition, while eriodictyol flavanone is inactive. It is clear that the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 and the ketone group at position 4 of flavonoids are necessary for potent inhibitory effect. The difference in inhibitory action appears to depend on the categorized subclass of flavonoids."

        "abstract": "Normal breast tissue mainly expresses the neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y2 receptor whereas primary human breast carcinomas express the Y1 receptor (Y1R) subtype. We hypothesized that activation of estrogen signaling systems plays a role in the induction of Y1R. To investigate this possibility, we used estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, and examined the effect of estrogen on Y1R gene expression and its signaling pathways. Saturation binding studies revealed that MCF-7 cells express high-affinity NPY receptor. NPY inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) in MCF-7 cells. Chronic estrogen treatment enhanced NPY-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation by 4-fold and caused a significant increase in Y1R mRNA expression through ERalpha. Similarly, estrogen increased Y1R mRNA expression in T-47D (ER+) but not in MDA-MB231 or MDA-MB468 (ER-) cell lines. Cycloheximide decreased basal Y1R mRNA expression; however, it did not affect its increase by estrogen. Moreover, estrogen treatment of MCF-7 cells did not increase Y1R mRNA stability. The up-regulation of Y1R expression by estrogen is prevented by hydroxyurea but not by nocodazole or IB-MECA (cell cycle inhibitors). Lastly, NPY inhibited estrogen-induced cell proliferation through Y1R. In conclusion, MCF-7 cells express a functional Y1R coupled to both Ca(2+) and cAMP pathways. Estrogen up-regulates Y1R expression through ERalpha. This effect is independent of increased Y1R mRNA stability or new protein synthesis, and likely occurs during S phase completion of the cell cycle. Estrogen plays an important role in the up-regulation of Y1R, which in turn regulates estrogen-induced cell proliferation in breast cancer cells."

Unlike the matched, traditionally grown tumor cell lines, TSCs derived directly from primary glioblastomas harbor extensive similarities to normal neural stem cells and recapitulate the genotype, gene expression patterns, and in vivo biology of human glioblastomas. These findings suggest that TSCs may be a more reliable model than many commonly utilized cancer cell lines for understanding the biology of primary human tumors. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "In our study, we found that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has a novel effect as an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) on Panc-1 cells, a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line. BMP4-treated Panc-1 cells showed loose cell contacts and a scattered, fibroblast-like appearance along with E-cadherin downregulation, Vimentin upregulation and enhanced cell migration, which are characteristic of EMT. BMP4 treatment also induced homeobox gene MSX2 expression, which we previously showed to be associated with EMT in pancreatic carcinoma cells. BMP4 treatment activated the Smad signaling pathway, and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathways in these cells. MSX2 was markedly induced by BMP4 through the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways in collaboration with the Smad signaling pathway. The repression of E-cadherin, induction of Vimentin and enhanced cell migration disappeared when siRNA-based MSX2 downregulated pancreatic cancer cells were treated with BMP4. These findings indicate that BMP4 may be involved in pancreatic carcinoma development through the promotion of EMT and that MSX2 is indispensable to this process."

Bladder cancer cells, however, lack specific cell surface markers, making this approach impracticable. In this study an alternative method was used, involving isolation of side population cells to explore the stem cell characteristics of bladder cancer. Side population cells were isolated from the bladder transitional cell cancer cell line T24 and examined for potential stem cell characteristics related to proliferation, cell cycle distribution, self-renewal and differentiation. It was observed that T24 side population cells have stronger proliferative and colony formation abilities than non-side population cells. Side population cells were also more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which may be due to expression of the ATP-binding cassette half-transporter, sub-family G, member 2 protein. Overall, the results suggest that side population cells from the human bladder transitional cell cancer cell line T24 harbour stem-like cells."

In breast cancer cells, Src is dispensable for homing to the bones or lungs but is critical for the survival and outgrowth of these cells in the bone marrow.

However, TRAIL, TNF-alpha and anti-Fas antibodies (Ab) treatment in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) converted the phenotype of DU145 from resistant to sensitive. TSA induced 15% cell death but simultaneous treatment with TRAIL, TNF-alpha and anti-Fas Ab resulted in 55%, 70% and 40% cell death, respectively. Simultaneous treatment did not increase the level of TSA-induced histone acetylation, but induced the release of acetylated histones from chromatin into the cytosol. This release was caspase dependent since it was abrogated by Z-VAD-fmk. In addition, treatment with TSA induced caspase-9 activation and resulted in the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria. To further investigate the role of caspase-9 in TSA-mediated apoptosis we used two different approaches: (1) cells were pretreated with the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-fmk, and (2) cells were transfected with a dominant-negative form of caspase-9. Both approaches gave similar results: cells became resistant to treatment with TSA. These data indicate that TSA mediates its effect via the mitochondrial pathway. This was confirmed by examining DU145 overexpressing Bcl-2. These transfectants were resistant to TSA treatment. Taken together, our data shows that only simultaneous treatment with TNF-family ligands and TSA in DU145 resulted in caspase activity sufficient to induce apoptosis. The combination of TSA and TNF-family ligands could potentially be the basis for the treatment of prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "Multiple chromosome 3p tumor suppressor genes (TSG) have been proposed in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer based on complex patterns of 3p loss. To attain functional evidence in support of TSGs and identify candidate regions, we applied a chromosome transfer method involving cell fusions of the tumorigenic OV90 human ovarian cancer cell line, monoallelic for 3p and an irradiated mouse cell line containing a human chromosome 3 in order to derive OV90 hybrids containing normal 3p fragments. The resulting hybrids showed complete or incomplete suppression of tumorigenicity in nude mouse xenograft assays, and varied in their ability to form colonies in soft agarose and three-dimensional spheroids in a manner consistent with alteration of their in vivo tumorigenic phenotypes. Expression microarray analysis identified a set of common differentially expressed genes, such as SPARC, DAB2 and VEGF, some of which have been shown implicated in ovarian cancer. Genotyping assays revealed that they harbored normal 3p fragments, some of which overlapped candidate TSG regions (3p25-p26, 3p24 and 3p14-pcen) identified previously in loss of heterozygosity analyses of ovarian cancers. However, only the 3p12-pcen region was acquired in common by all hybrids where expression microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes. The correlation of 3p12-pcen transfer and tumor suppression with a concerted re-programming of the cellular transcriptome suggest that the putative TSG may have affected key underlying events in ovarian cancer."

Here, we demonstrate that synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), driven by GCLM, is required for cancer initiation. Genetic loss of Gclm prevents a tumor's ability to drive malignant transformation. Intriguingly, these findings canbe replicated using an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, but only if delivered prior to cancer onset, suggesting that at later stages of tumor progression GSH becomes dispensable potentially due to compensation from alternative antioxidant pathways. Remarkably, combined inhibition of GSH and thioredoxin antioxidant pathways leads to a synergistic cancer cell death invitro and invivo, demonstrating theimportance of these two antioxidants to tumor progression and as potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

To identify genes that can be used to specifically target such cancers, we carried out a genetic screen in Drosophila. We identified gig (fly TSC2) and found that inactivation of rbf (fly Rb) and gig synergistically induced cell death. Interestingly, inactivation of TSC2 specifically kills Rb mutant cancer cells under stress conditions, which is correlated with an inhibition of tumor growth. We show that cancer cell killing induced by concomitant inactivation of Rb and TSC2 is mediated by increased cellular stress, including oxidative stress. Inactivation of TSC2 and Rb synergistically induce oxidative stress via increased protein synthesis, inhibited de novo lipid synthesis, and decreased reactive oxygen species scavenger enzyme SOD2 induction. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In accord with this common transcriptional program, many drugs used for treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases inhibit transformation and tumor growth. Unexpectedly, lipid metabolism genes are important for transformation and are upregulated in cancer tissues. As in atherosclerosis, oxidized LDL and its receptor OLR1 activate the inflammatory pathway through NF-??B, leading to transformation. OLR1 is important for maintaining the transformed state in developmentally diverse cancer cell lines and for tumor growth, suggesting a molecular connection between cancer and atherosclerosis. We suggest that the interplay between this common transcriptional program and cell-type-specific factors gives rise to phenotypically disparate human diseases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

For photodynamic effects, cell death 48 h after UV-A irradiation was more prominent in cells preloaded with DP than DFP. When cells were simply incubated for 96 h without irradiation, DFP induced cell death, while DP suppressed cell proliferation. Furthermore, DP was much more soluble in water than DFP.

An 1.8 kb human p53 full length cDNA was inserted into a mammalian expression vector PEGFP to construct a p53 antisense RNA recombined plasmid PEGFP-p53(AS) and GFP gene at plasmid was a report gene to monitor extraneous gene expression. The extraneous gene was detected by PCR. The p53 mutation protein was examined by immunohitochemical stain of p53 monoclonal antibody. The inhibition growth efficacy of extraneous p53 in vitro was determined by clonogenic survival assay. Sensitivity of cells to cisplatin was examined with MTT assay. FCM analysis was performed to measure the effect of p53 antisense RNA on cell cycle.\\n\\nRESULTS: Two cell lines, PEGFP-p53(AS)-801D and PEGFP-801D, were established after transfection of 801-D cells by lipofection and selection. Presence of extraneous p53 gene in PEGFP-p53(AS)-801D was proved by PCR and expression of extraneous p53 was estimated when green fluorescence in those cells was found out under the fluorescent microscopy. Mutated p53 protein in parent cell line 801D was positive and in PEGFP-p53(AS)-801D was negative with immunochemical stain. The inhibition rate of colony formation was 61% for PEGFP-p53(AS)-801D (P < 0.001). The sensitivity of PEGFP-p53(AS)-801D cells to cisplatin was increased. FCM analysis showed that the cell line was arrested at G1 phase.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: p53 mutation at 248 code plays an important role on malignant growth and resistance to cisplatin of human lung cancer cell line 801D. Malignant growth of cells with p53 deletion and mutation at 248 codon can be inhibited by extraneous p53 antisense RNA, and simultaneously the sensitivity to cisplatin is also increased."

        "abstract": "Metastasis is the major cause of breast cancer mortality. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) generated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 activates AKT, which promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and regulates migration. To date, none of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases that inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling have been reported as tumor suppressors in breast cancer. Here, we show depletion of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase PIPP (INPP5J) increases breast cancer cell transformation, but reduces cell migration and invasion. Pipp ablation accelerates oncogene-driven breast cancer tumor growth in vivo, but paradoxically reduces metastasis by regulating AKT1-dependent tumor cell migration. PIPP mRNA expression is reduced in human ER-negative breast cancers associated with reduced long-term outcome. Collectively, our findings identify PIPP as a suppressor of oncogenic PI3K/AKT signaling in breast cancer. Ooms et al. identify the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase PIPP as a suppressor of oncogenic PI3K/AKT signaling in breast cancer. PIPP depletion increases transformation and accelerates oncogene-driven tumor growth in vivo, while paradoxically reducing cell migration, invasion, and metastasis."

The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 was used as control. Our results show that in MCF-7 cells, I- uptake is sustained and dependent on NIS, whereas I2 uptake is transient with a maximal peak at 10 min and a final retention of 10% of total uptake. In contrast, no I- was taken up by NIH3T3 cells, and although I2 was captured with the same time pattern as in MCF-7 cells, its uptake was significantly lower, and it was not retained within the cell. The uptake of I2 is independent of NIS, PDS, Na+, and energy, but it is saturable and dependent on protein synthesis, suggesting a facilitated diffusion system. Radioiodine was incorporated into protein and lipid fractions only with I2 treatment. The administration of non-radiolabeled I2 and 6-iodo-5-hydroxy-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (6-iodolactone, an iodinated arachidonic acid), but not KI, significantly inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Proliferation of NIH3T3 cells was not inhibited by 20 microM I2. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that I2 uptake does not depend on NIS or PDS; they suggest that in mammary cancer cells, I2 is taken up by a facilitated diffusion system and then covalently bound to lipids or proteins that, in turn, inhibit proliferation."

Transcription of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 is regulated by expression of the E2 protein. Disruption of the E2 gene sequence due to viral integration results in upregulation of E6 and E7, which promote tumorigenesis by abrogating p53 and pRb functions. HPV integration sites in cervical and anogenital cancers have been mapped primarily to chromosomal fragile sites and in some cases have been shown to integrate within tumor suppressor genes or other cancer-related genes. To study viral integration sites in SCCHN, we examined an HPV16-infected SCCHN cell line cultured from a tongue-base tumor. HPV fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed multiple integrated viral DNA copies in blocks throughout the genome. Sequential FISH and spectral karyotyping identified integration sites on chromosomes 3, 6, 9q, 13q and t(1;8)(q;?). Restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (RS-PCR) was performed to identify the viral-cellular junctions. Sequence analyses confirmed integration sites at 9q31.1 and 6p21 and revealed a novel junction at 16p12.3. Subsequent chromosome breakage studies suggested that the observed viral-cellular integration sites may have occurred within common fragile sites. Additional studies using RT-PCR for E6/\\E7 viral transcripts showed oncoprotein expression from episomal and integrated viral sequences. Our results suggest that viral integration of HPV in SCCHN appears to occur nonrandomly through targeting specific chromosomal sequences prone to breakage. \u00a9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to bone. However, unlike many other tumors that produce osteolytic lesions, prostate cancer produces osteoblastic lesions through unknown mechanisms. In the current study, we explored the ability and mechanism of an osteotropic prostate cancer cell line (C4-2B) to induce mineralization. METHODS: C4-2B cells were grown in promineralization media. Mineral deposition was characterized using von Kossa staining, calcium retention, alizarin red staining, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. Expression of osteoblast-related proteins was determined by RT-PCR. The nuclear level of the bone-specific transcription factor Cbfa1 was determined using western analysis and the effect of inhibiting Cbfa1 function, using a \"decoy\" Cbfa1 response element oligo, on mineralization was determined. RESULTS: The studies demonstrated that C4-2B cells, but not its nonosteotropic parent cell line LNCaP, has an osteoblastlike phenotype including production of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and OPG ligand. Most importantly, the C4-2B cells produced hydroxyapatite mineral in vitro. Furthermore, C4-2B cells expressed high nuclear levels of the bone-specific transcription factor Cbfa1, compared to LNCaP cells, which accounts for their ability to produce bone-specific proteins. Inhibition of Cbfa1, using decoy DNA Cbfa1 response elements, abrogated the ability of C4-2B to produce mineral. Finally, we determined that C4-2B cells express bone morphogenic protein-7, a known inducer of Cbfa1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a novel mechanism through which prostate cancer cells may directly contribute to the osteoblastic component that characterize their skeletal metastatic lesions.

        "abstract": "Cdk5 is a small serine/threonine protein kinase which belongs to Cdk family. Unlike other Cdk members, so far Cdk5 is known to be irrelevant in cell cycle. Cdk5 kinase activity is regulated by binding with its activator, p35. Our previous results indicate that CdkS and p35 are involved in drugs-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Retinoic acid (RA) is one of the vitamin A-related compounds. Because of its potency on biological functions, it has been widely studied in its novel actions including the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and to induce apoptosis. Here, we report that RA treatment decreased the growth of human cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, and Cdk5 contributed to this effect. The involvement of Cdk5 in RA-reduced cell survival was performed by treatments of Cdk5 inhibitor and siRNA. We further identified that RA-induced growth inhibition was partly correlated to Cdk5 activity-related apoptosis by detecting cell cycle distribution of sub G1 phase and the signals of Annexin V staining. In addition, our results also indicated that Cdk5 activity was involved in RA-induced HeLa apoptosis by detecting cleavages of caspase-3 and its substrate, PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases) Interestingly, the nuclear localizations of Cdk5 and p35 proteins were increased by RA treatment, which, again, suggests the involvement of Cdk5 and p35 in RA-induced apoptotic effects. In conclusion, we provide evidence to suggest that Cdk5 and p35 might play important roles in RA-induced HeLa apoptosis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Zinc finger protein 139 (ZNF139) gene is proved play an important role in gastric cancer. Aim of this study is to identify changes of proteins after ZNF139 gene was inhibited in gastric cancer cell line BGC823. METHODS: siRNA-specific ZNF139 was synthesized and transfected into BGC823; 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were applied to screen, identify differentially expressed proteins, and function of these proteins was analyzed; Western blot method was applied to verify the identified proteins. RESULTS: ZNF139 expression in siRNA transfected cancer cell BGC823 decreased significantly. Results of 2-D DIGE showed eight differential protein spots, of which seven were identified with LC-MS, including switches associated protein 70, far upstream element binding protein 1, heat shock protein 60, annexin A7, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 activating enzyme, chaperonin-containing tail-less complex protein 1 and annexin A2. These proteins were found to be associated with proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, adhesion of gastric cancer cells with bioinformatic analysis. Western blot analysis confirmed that expressions of these proteins in BGC823 were consistent with the proteomic results. CONCLUSIONS: ZNF139 gene may influence the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells in many ways by regulating multiple proteins."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between patched 1 (PTCH1) expression and its methylation in a human gastric cancer cell line, in order to provide new information regarding carcinogenesis and the development of gastric cancer. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the immunocytochemical S-P method were used to identify the changes in PTCH1 mRNA and protein expression prior to and following the treatment of the AGS human gastric cancer cell line with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc), a methylation inhibitor. The methylation status of the promoter region of the PTCH1 gene in the AGS gastric cancer cell line was examined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), while CpG island methylation in the PTCH1 gene 5' regulatory sequence was analyzed using DNA methylation analysis software. The expression of PTCH1 mRNA and protein was absent in the AGS gastric cancer cell line prior to 5-Aza-dc treatment. However, the expression of PTCH1 mRNA and protein appeared in the AGS cells treated with 5-Aza-dc. CpG island hypermethylation of the PTCH1 gene was observed in the AGS gastric cancer cell line using MSP combined with DNA sequencing. PTCH1 expression was negatively correlated with the level of promoter methylation in the AGS cells. In conclusion, the high level of methylation in the PTCH1 gene promoter region may be involved in carcinogenesis and the development of gastric cancer, and may provide a new biomarker for gastric cancer."

To understand the mechanism of MDR better, a subcellular proteomics approach was used to compare the protein profile between vincristine-resistant human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/VCR and its parental cell line SGC7901.  After differential solubilization, the subfractionation proteins were sep. by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and the differential protein spots were identified by both MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-Q-TOF-MS.  Then the differential expressional levels of partial identified proteins were detd. by Western blot anal.  Furthermore, one of the highly expressed proteins in SGC7901/VCR, Sorcin, assocd. with MDR was analyzed.  In this study, the well-resolved, reproducible 2-DE patterns of subfractionation proteins from SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901 were established, and 30 differential proteins between the two cell lines were identified.  The functional validation showed that the elevated sorcin expression could contribute considerably to the vincristine resistance in SGC7901/VCR.  The 30 differentially expressed proteins could be divided into six groups based on their functions: calcium binding proteins, chaperones, metabolic enzymes, proteins relative to signal transduction, proteins involved in transcription and translation, and transportation proteins, and most of them might be new MDR assocd. proteins, which have not been detected previously.  These data will be valuable for further to study the mechanisms of MDR in human gastric cancer. [on SciFinder(R)]"

        "abstract": "In this work we investigated the mode of cell death induced by WP 631, a novel anthracycline antibiotic, in the ovarian cancer cell line (OV-90) derived from the malignant ascites of a patient diagnosed with advanced disease. The effects were compared with those of doxorubicin (DOX), a first generation anthracycline. The ability of WP 631 to induce apoptosis and necrosis was examined by double staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide, measurements of the level of intracellular calcium ions and cytochrome c, PARP cleavage. We also investigated the possible involvement of the caspases activation, DNA degradation (comet assay) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the development of the apoptotic events and their significance for drug efficiency. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that antiproliferative capacity of WP 631 in tested cell line was a few times greater than that of DOX. Furthermore, ovarian cancer cells treated with WP 631 showed a higher mean level of basal DNA damage in comparison to DOX. In conclusion, WP 631 is able to induce caspase - dependent apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. Obtained results suggested that WP 631 may be a candidate for further evaluation as chemotherapeutic agents for human cancers."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although neuroendocrine (NE) cells in prostate cancer have been speculated to accelerate the growth and progression of surrounding cancer cells, the evidence is as yet inconclusive. We investigated the effect of an NE allograft (NE-10) and its cell line, NE-CS, which were established from the prostate of the LPB-Tag 12T-10 transgenic mouse, on human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. METHODS: The proliferation and pulmonary metastasis of LNCaP xenografts in athymic mice with and without NE-10 allografts were evaluated. Boyden chamber assay and microarray analysis were performed to investigate changes in invasion/migration and mRNA of LNCaP cells under the influence of the NE cells, respectively. RESULTS: NE-10 did not influence the proliferation of LNCaP. The pulmonary metastasis of LNCaP with NE-10 significantly increased compared to mice without it. The NE-CS cells accelerated the in vitro invasion/migration of adenocarcinoma cells. Increased expression of mRNA of gelsolin was observed in LNCaP cells incubated with the supernatant of NE-CS cells. CONCLUSIONS: The NE-10 allograft promotes pulmonary metastasis of subcutaneously inoculated LNCaP cells by facilitating cell invasion. Secretions from NE cells upregulate the expression of gelsolin, which is an actin-binding protein, resulting in acceleration of the migration of LNCaP cells."

        "abstract": "Mechanical interaction between cells - specifically distortion of tensional homeostasis-emerged as an important aspect of breast cancer genesis and progression. We investigated the biophysical characteristics of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) in the malignant MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. MSCs turned out to be the most abundant ion channel species and could be activated by negative pressure at the outer side of the cell membrane in a saturable manner. Assessing single channel conductance (G\u039b) for different monovalent cations revealed an increase in the succession: Li(+) < Na(+) < K(+) \u2248Rb(+) \u2248 Cs(+). Divalent cations permeated also with the order: Ca(2+) < Ba(2+). Comparison of biophysical properties enabled us to identify MSCs in MCF-7 as ion channels formed by the Piezo1 protein. Using patch clamp technique no functional MSCs were observed in the benign MCF-10A mammary epithelial cell line. Blocking of MSCs by GsMTx-4 resulted in decreased motility of MCF-7, but not of MCF-10A cells, underscoring a possible role of Piezo1 in invasion and metastatic propagation. The role of Piezo1 in biology and progression of breast cancer is further substantiated by markedly reduced overall survival in patients with increased Piezo1 mRNA levels in the primary tumor."

The capacity of a pure mammalian lignan, enterolactone (ENL), to influence the proliferation of the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line was investigated as a function of cell density, metabolic activity, expression and secretion of prostate specific antigen (PSA), cell cycle profile, and the expression of genes involved in development and progression of prostate cancer. Treatment with a subcytotoxic concentration of ENL (60 muM for 72 h) was found to reduce: cell density (57.5%, SD 7.23, p < 0.001), metabolic activity (55%, SD 0.03, p < 0.001), secretion of PSA (48.50% SD 4.74, p = 0.05) and induce apoptosis (8.33-fold SD 0.04, p = 0.001) compared to untreated cells. Cotreatment with 10 muM etoposide was found to increase apoptosis by 50.17% (SD 0.02, p < 0.001). Additionally, several key genes (e. g. MCMs, survivin and CDKs) were beneficially regulated by ENL treatment (p < 0.05). The data suggest that the antiproliferative activity of ENL is a consequence of altered expression of cell cycle associated genes and provides novel molecular evidence for the antiproliferative properties of a pure lignan in prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "Here, we developed polymeric microfluidic devices for the isolation of circulating tumor cells. The devices, with more than 30,000 microposts in the channel, were produced successfully by a UV light-curing process lasting 3\u00a0min. The device surface was coated with anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule antibody by just contacting the antibody solution, and a flow system including the device was established to send a cell suspension through it. We carried out flow tests for evaluation of the device's ability to capture tumor cells using an esophageal cancer cell line, KYSE220, dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline or mononuclear cell separation from whole blood. After the suspension flowed through the chip, many cells were seen to be captured on the microposts coated with the antibody, whereas there were few cells in the device without the antibody. Owing to the transparency of the device, we could observe the intact and the stained cells captured on the microposts by transmitted light microscopy and phase contrast microscopy, in addition to fluorescent microscopy, which required fluorescence labeling. Cell capture efficiencies (i.e., recovery rates of the flowing cancer cells by capture with the microfluidic device) were measured. The resulting values were 0.88 and 0.95 for cell suspension in phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.85 for the suspension in the mononuclear cell separation, suggesting the sufficiency of this device for the isolation of circulating tumor cells. Therefore, our device may be useful for research and treatments that rely on investigation of circulating tumor cells in the blood of cancer patients."

        "abstract": "Several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are associated with anti-cancer activity. At the same time, many AEDs alter endocrine function with phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB) causing-reduced free fractions of sex-steroid hormones, while VPA induces hyperandrogenism. Changes in sex-steroid hormone levels are known to affect apoptosis in endocrine tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the antiepileptic drugs PHT, PB, VPA and lamotrigine (LTG) on estrogen-stimulated cell growth of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and to evaluate whether this effect could be related to a direct estrogen receptor (ER) binding. VPA reduced cell growth at therapeutically relevant concentrations; half-maximum effect of VPA on cell growth was 230 microM. PHT (100 microM) and PB (10 microM) reduced cell growth by 47 and 21%, respectively. None of the drugs had affinity to isolated estrogen receptors, and excess of estrogen was not able to abolish the growth inhibition provoked by VPA. However, sub-therapeutic concentrations of VPA (100 microM) mimicked estrogen by inducing cell growth (11%) in an estrogen-depleted medium, an effect that was abolished by adding an estrogen receptor antagonist. In conclusion; the estrogen receptor appear to be indirectly activated by sub-therapeutic concentrations of VPA, but therapeutic concentrations of VPA inhibits cell growth by mechanisms that do not seem to involve the estrogen receptor or estrogen stimulation."

However, we show that the related cytokine IL-11 has a stronger correlation with elevated STAT3 activation in human gastrointestinal cancers. Using genetic mouse models, we reveal that IL-11 has a more prominent role compared to IL-6 during the progression of sporadic and inflammation-associated colon and gastric cancers. Accordingly, in these models and in human tumor cell line xenograft models, pharmacologic inhibition of IL-11 signaling alleviated STAT3 activation, suppressed tumor cell proliferation, and reduced the invasive capacity and growth of tumors.

A significant decrease in intracellular Cl(-) and K(+)and a progressive increase in Mg(2+) and Na(+) were observed, with parallel changes in cellular volume as cells passed through three morphological stages of apoptosis.

        "title": "Reversal effects of nomegestrol acetate on multidrug resistance in adriamycin-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cell line.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is important in the systematic treatment of breast cancer. To enhance the response of tumours to chemotherapy, attention has been focused on agents to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) and on the sensitivity of tumour cells to chemical drugs. Hundreds of reversal drugs have been found in vitro, but their clinical application has been limited because of their toxicity. The reversal activity of progestogen compounds has been demonstrated. However, classical agents such as progesterone and megestrol (MG) also have high toxicity. Nomegestrol (NOM) belongs to a new derivation of progestogens and shows very low toxicity. We studied the reversal activity of NOM and compared it with that of verapamil (VRP), droloxifene (DRO), tamoxifen (TAM) and MG, and investigated the reversal mechanism, i.e. effects on the expression of the MDR1, glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTpi), MDR-related protein (MRP) and topoisomerase IIalpha (TopoIIalpha) genes, as well as the intracellular drug concentration and the cell cycle. The aim of the study was to examine the reversal effects of NOM on MDR in MCF7/ADR, an MCF7 breast cancer cell line resistant to adriamycin (ADR), and its mechanism of action. METHODS: MCF7/ADR cells and MCF7/WT, an MCF7 breast cancer cell line sensitive to ADR, were treated with NOM as the acetate ester. With an assay based on a tetrazolium dye [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; MTT], the effects of various concentrations of NOM on MDR in MCF7/ADR cells were studied. Before and after the treatment with 5 microM NOM, the expression of the MDR-related genes MDR1, GSTpi, TopoIIalpha and MRP were assayed with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) immunocytochemistry assay. By using flow cytometry (FCM), we observed the intracellular ADR concentration and the effects of combined treatment with NOM and ADR on the cell cycle. Results collected were analysed with Student's t test. RESULTS: NOM significantly reversed MDR in MCF7/ADR cells. After treatment NOM at 20, 10 and 5 microM, chemosensitivity to ADR increased 21-fold, 12-fold and 8-fold, respectively. The reversal activity of NOM was stronger than that of the precursor compound MG, and comparable to that of VRP. After treatment with 5 microM NOM, the expression of both the MDR1 and the GSTpi mRNA genes began to decline on the second day (P <0.05 and P <0.01, respectively), and reached the lowest level on the third day (both P <0.01); however, on the fifth day the expression levels began to increase again (both P <0.05). The expression of MRP and TopoIIalpha had no significant changes. Changes in the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and GSTpi were similar to those of their mRNA expressions, showing early declines and late increases. Two hours after treatment with 20, 10 and 5 microM NOM, the intracellular ADR concentration increased 2.7-fold, 2.3-fold and 1.5-fold respectively. However, NOM did not increase ADR accumulation in MCF7/WT cells. FCM data showed that after 48 h of combined administration of NOM (20 microM) and ADR (from low to high concentration), MCF7/ADR cells showed a gradual arrest at the G2M phase with increasing ADR dose. The arrest effect with combined drug treatment was stronger than that with the single ADR treatment. CONCLUSION: MDR is the major mechanism of drug resistance in malignant tumour cells. To overcome MDR and to increase chemosensitivity, many reversal agents have been found. Most progestogen compounds have been demonstrated to have reversal effects, but we found no data on NOM, a new progestogen compound. Our results show that NOM has strong reversal activity. The reversal effects were stronger than those of the precursor compound, MG, and were comparable to that of VRP. Because NOM has low toxicity, it might have good prospects in clinical application. Using RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry assays, we studied the effects of NOM on MDR-related genes. The results were that NOM could markedly downregulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of MDR1 and GSTpi. TopoIIalpha and MRP gene expression showed no significant changes. It is known that P-gp induces MDR in tumour cells mainly by decreasing the intracellular drug concentration. After treatment with NOM, the intracellular drug concentration in MCF7/ADR cells increased significantly. Combined treatment with NOM and ADR induced arrest at the G2M phase. It is worth noting that NOM caused an early decrease and a late increase in the expression of some MDR-related genes in a time-dependent manner. The phenomena raise a question for the continued administration of reversal agents in clinics that merits further study. We demonstrate that NOM has strong reversal effects on MDR in MCF7/ADR cells. The reversal is via different routes, namely downregulating the mRNA and protein expression levels of MDR1 and GSTpi, increasing intracellular drug concentration and arresting cells at the G2M phase (NOM in combination with ADR). The reversal mechanism needs further study."

Strikingly, we find that BMH-21 causes proteasome-dependent destruction of RPA194, the large catalytic subunit protein of Pol I holocomplex, and this correlates with cancer cell killing.

        "abstract": "A sensitive and specific RP-HPLC assay was developed to measure the levels of polymorphonuclear elastase (PMN-E) activity in growing cell cultures. By combining a pre-incubation of the cells with a relatively non-toxic, PMN-E-specific inhibitor, MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (MAAPVCK), the p-nitroaniline formed by the hydrolysis of the substrate MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-NA by PMN-E is quantified. Elastase-like activity was measured in 14 human cells lines: 13 cancer cell lines (HL-60, U-937, A-427, LCLC-103H, YAPC, DAN-G, PA-TU-8902, KYSE-70, -510, -520, 5637, SISO and MCF-7) and one immortalized epithelial cell line (hTert-RPE1). Activity was detected in all lines; the lowest was found in hTert-RPE1 cells while the highest was detected in a pancreas adenocarcinoma line (PA-TU-8902). When the results were normalized according to cell volume instead of cell number, the leukemia line HL-60 had the highest activity and PA-TU-8902 ranked second. A 1 h pre-incubation with 9.0 microM of the irreversible PMN-E inhibitor MAAPVCK led to varying degrees of enzyme inhibition depending on the cell line; the strongest inhibition was observed with the PA-TU-8902 pancreatic cancer cell line (90% inhibition) while the weakest was seen with the A-427 lung cancer cell line (52%). These results indicate that PA-TU-8902 is a suitable in vitro model for testing the efficacy of PMN-E-activated prodrugs of antitumor agents."

Methods: BEL-7404 was taken as the object of study and conventional culture was performed. It wastreated by doxorubicin and (or) veliparib after 24 h. Cell proliferation rate was detected by four methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell apoptosis was measured with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method by flow cytometry, DNA damage degree evaluation by single cell gel electrophoresis assay, and cytosolic C levels of the mitochondrial and cytosol by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Western blotting).

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a major cause for death of gynecological cancer patients. The efficacy of traditional surgery and chemotherapy is rather compromised and platinum-resistant cancer recurs. Finding new therapeutic targets is urgently needed to increase the survival rate and to improve life quality of patients with ovarian cancer. In the present work, phosphoproteomic analysis was carried out on untreated and gossypol-treated ovarian cancer cell line, HOC1a. We identified approximately 9750 phosphopeptides from 3030 phosphoproteins, which are involved in diverse cellular processes including cytoskeletal organization, RNA and nucleotide binding, and cell cycle regulation. Upon gossypol treatment, changes in phosphorylation of twenty-nine proteins including YAP1 and AKAP12 were characterized. Western blotting and qPCR analysis were used to determine expression levels of proteins in YAP1-related Hippo pathway showing that gossypol induced upregulation of LATS1, which phosphorylates YAP1 at Ser 61. Furthermore, our data showed that gossypol targets the actin cytoskeletal organization through mediating phosphorylation states of actin-binding proteins. Taken together, our data provide valuable information to understand effects of gossypol on protein phosphorylation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells."

METHODS: BGC-823 cells were transfected transiently with adenovirus-Ang-1 (Ad-Ang-1). Cells transfected transiently with adenovirus-green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) and untransfected cells were used as a negative and blank control group, respectively. The cell adhesion rate between cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) was determined by cell adhesion assay. To investigate whether Ang-1 could reinforce gastric carcinoma metastasis, we performed migration and invasion assays in BGC-823 cells. The mRNA and protein expression of integrin beta1, CD44V6, uPA and MMP-2 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. The expression of integrin beta1 and CD44V6 was measured by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: BGC-823 cells were transfected successfully. The adhesion rate increased significantly in the Ad-Ang-1 group (P < 0.05). The Ad-Ang-1-transfected group had a significant increase in migration and invasion compared with that of the mock-transfected and Ad-GFP groups. The mRNA and protein expression of integrin beta1, CD44V6, uPA and MMP-2 in the Ad-Ang-1 group was higher than that in the Ad-GFP and blank control groups (P < 0.05). Compared with mock-transfected and Ad-GFP groups, integrin beta1 and CD44V6 expression intensity greatly increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Transfection of Ang-1 into human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 can significantly increase expression of integrin beta1 and CD44V6, by which cell adhesion and metastasis to the ECM are promoted."

        "abstract": "Hypoxia, frequently found in the center of solid tumors, may lead to enhance the production of key factor in cell survival, invasion, angiogenesis and loss of apoptosis. The low oxygen tension in hypoxic tumors is also known to interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms are not very clear. Paclitaxel (PTX) is an active agent used in breast cancer chemotherapy, which disturbs microtubule dynamics and impairs the transition of cells from metaphase to anaphase in mitosis, leading to cell death by apoptosis. In the present study, we try to determine whether hypoxia can decrease the chemosensitivity of human breast carcinoma cells to PTX and elucidate the underlying mechanism. We found that hypoxia could decrease PTX-induced cell death and G 2/M arrest. Furthermore, our results showed that hypoxia inhibit PTX-induced soluble tubulin polymerized. In addition, we also found hypoxia could suppress PTX-induced cell cycle protein-cyclin B1 expression in MCF-7 cells. To further investigate whether the inhibitory effect of hypoxia on PTX-induced cell death is mediated by decreasing levels of cyclin B1, cyclin B1-transfected MCF-7 cells were used under hypoxic condition. The data showed that the hypoxia-based decreasing chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to PTX was reversed by cyclin B1. We also found that overexpression of cyclin B1 could significantly increase the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to PTX by stimulating soluble polymerized tubulin. Overall, hypoxia decreases cyclin B1, which could in turn reverse hypoxia-induced decreasing chemosensitivity to PTX in breast cancer cell line MCF-7. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS."

METHODS: We analyzed the presence of SP cells in different human gastric carcinoma cell lines, and then isolated and identified the SP cells from the KATO III human gastric cancer cell line by flow cytometry. The clonogenic ability and self-renewal were evaluated by clone and sphere formation assays. The related genes were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To compare tumorigenic ability, SP and non-side population (NSP) cells from the KATO III human gastric cancer cell line were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. RESULTS: SP cells from the total population accounted for 0.57% in KATO III, 1.04% in Hs-746T, and 0.02% in AGS (CRL-1739). SP cells could grow clonally and have self-renewal capability in conditioned media. The expression of ABCG2, MDRI, Bmi-1 and Oct-4 was different between SP and NSP cells. However, there was no apparent difference between SP and NSP cells when they were injected into nude mice.

In this study, we examined whether hypoxia can affect the levels of DNase I activity and/or its transcripts in vitro. We first exposed the human pancreatic cancer cell line QGP-1, which is the first documented DNase-I-producing cell line, to hypoxia (2% O2), and found that this induced a significant increase in both the activity and transcripts of DNase I. This response was mediated by increased transcription only from exon 1a of the two alternative transcription-initiating exons utilized simultaneously in the human DNase I gene (DNASE1); exposure of QGP-1 cells to hypoxia for 24 h resulted in a 15-fold increase of DNASE1 transcripts starting from exon 1a compared with the expression level under normoxic conditions. Promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with QGP-1 cells exposed to hypoxia or normoxia showed that the region just upstream from exon 1a was involved in this response in a hypoxia-induced factor-1-independent, but at least in a Sp1 transcription factor-dependent manner possibly through enhanced binding of Sp1 protein to the promoter. These results indicate that DNASE1 expression is upregulated by hypoxia in the cells."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth-factor receptor (HER)-2 is overexpressed in 25\u00a0% of breast-cancers and is associated with an aggressive form of the disease with significantly shortened disease free and overall survival. In recent years, the use of HER2-targeted therapies, monoclonal-antibodies and small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors has significantly improved the clinical outcome for HER2-positive breast-cancer patients. However, only a fraction of HER2-amplified patients will respond to therapy and the use of these treatments is often limited by tumour drug insensitivity or resistance and drug toxicities. Currently there is no way to identify likely responders or rational combinations with the potential to improve HER2-focussed treatment outcome.\\n\\nMETHODS: In order to further understand the molecular mechanisms of treatment-response with HER2-inhibitors, we used a highly-optimised and reproducible quantitative label-free LC-MS strategy to characterize the proteomes of HER2-overexpressing breast-cancer cell-lines (SKBR3, BT474 and HCC1954) in response to drug-treatment with HER2-inhibitors (lapatinib, neratinib or afatinib).\\n\\nRESULTS: Following 12\u00a0hours treatment with different HER2-inhibitors in the BT474 cell-line; compared to the untreated cells, 16 proteins changed significantly in abundance following lapatinib treatment (1\u00a0\u03bcM), 21 proteins changed significantly following neratinib treatment (150 nM) and 38 proteins changed significantly following afatinib treatment (150 nM). Whereas following 24\u00a0hours treatment with neratinib (200 nM) 46 proteins changed significantly in abundance in the HCC1954 cell-line and 23 proteins in the SKBR3 cell-line compared to the untreated cells. Analysing the data we found that, proteins like trifunctional-enzyme subunit-alpha, mitochondrial; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-R and lamina-associated polypeptide 2, isoform alpha were up-regulated whereas heat shock cognate 71\u00a0kDa protein was down-regulated in 3 or more comparisons.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This proteomic study highlights several proteins that are closely associated with early HER2-inhibitor response and will provide a valuable resource for further investigation of ways to improve efficacy of breast-cancer treatment."

Extracellular matrix (ECM) can affect drug resistance by preventing the penetration of the drug into cancer cells and increased resistance to apoptosis. This study demonstrates alterations in the expression levels of ECM components and related genes in cisplatin-, doxorubicin-, topotecan-, and paclitaxel-resistant variants of the A2780 ovarian cancer cell line. Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Genome Array Strips were used for hybridisations. The genes that had altered expression levels in drug-resistant sublines were selected and filtered by scatter plots. The genes that were up- or downregulated more than fivefold were selected and listed. Among the investigated genes, 28 genes were upregulated, 10 genes were downregulated, and two genes were down- or upregulated depending on the cell line. Between upregulated genes 12 were upregulated very significantly--over 20-fold. These genes included COL1A2, COL12A1, COL21A1, LOX, TGFBI, LAMB1, EFEMP1, GPC3, SDC2, MGP, MMP3, and TIMP3. Four genes were very significantly downregulated: COL11A1, LAMA2, GPC6, and LUM. The expression profiles of investigated genes provide a preliminary insight into the relationship between drug resistance and the expression of ECM components. Identifying correlations between investigated genes and drug resistance will require further analysis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding vertebrate lectin. In human prostate cancer, galectin-3 expression has been shown to decrease with progression of disease. In the present study, we further investigated the role of galectin-3 in this malignancy by examining the phenotype of galectin-3-transfected prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Stably transfected galectin-3-expressing cell lines were developed from the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which does not constitutively express this molecule. Transfected cells lines were analyzed for alterations in morphology and growth rates, and for ability to form tumors in nude mice. RESULTS: Morphologically, when compared to the parental LNCaP cells, the galectin-3 transfectants had broader, flatter cell bodies, shorter and less finely branched dendritic processes, and large nuclei with pronounced and often multiple nucleoli. The galectin-3 lines were found to proliferate at a slower rate in vitro than either the vector control-transfected lines or parental LNCaP. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, four of six galectin-3 lines formed tumors at a slower rate than control lines. Twenty-four tumors that formed from the transfected cell lines were examined by immunohistochemistry for galectin-3 expression. Only one tumor was found to express galectin-3, suggesting that the transfected cells which formed tumors were those which successfully down-regulated galectin-3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to an apparent stimulatory role in some tumor types, galectin-3 is an inhibitory molecule for prostate cancer."

The isolation and identification of CSCs could help to develop novel therapeutic strategies specifically targeting CSCs. In this study, we enriched gastric cancer stem cells through spheroid body formation by cultivating the human gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 in defined serum-free medium. The stemness characteristics of spheroid body-forming cells, including self-renewal, proliferation, chemoresistance, tumorigenicity of the MKN-45 spheroid body-forming cells were evaluated, and the expression levels of stemness genes and related proteins in the MKN-45 spheroid body-forming cells were assessed. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining for the stem cell markers on spheroid body-forming cells was examined to evaluate the association between stemness factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog) and the proposed CSC marker CD44. Our data demonstrated that non-adherent spheroid body-forming cells from the gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 cultured in stem cell-conditioned medium possessed gastric CSC properties, such as persistent self-renewal, extensive proliferation, drug resistance, high tumorigenic capacity and overexpression of CSC-related genes and proteins (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and CD44), compared with the parental cells. More importantly, CD44-positive cells co-expressing the pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog may represent gastric CSCs. Further experiments using more refined selection criteria such as a combination of two or multiple markers would be useful to specifically identify and purify CSCs."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urothelial bladder cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Cancer cell lines are useful tools for its study. This is a comprehensive genomic characterization of 40 urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) cell lines including information on origin, mutation status of genes implicated in bladder cancer (FGFR3, PIK3CA, TP53, and RAS), copy number alterations assessed using high density SNP arrays, uniparental disomy (UPD) events, and gene expression.\\n\\nRESULTS: Based on gene mutation patterns and genomic changes we identify lines representative of the FGFR3-driven tumor pathway and of the TP53/RB tumor suppressor-driven pathway. High-density array copy number analysis identified significant focal gains (1q32, 5p13.1-12, 7q11, and 7q33) and losses (i.e. 6p22.1) in regions altered in tumors but not previously described as affected in bladder cell lines. We also identify new evidence for frequent regions of UPD, often coinciding with regions reported to be lost in tumors. Previously undescribed chromosome X losses found in UBC lines also point to potential tumor suppressor genes. Cell lines representative of the FGFR3-driven pathway showed a lower number of UPD events.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is a predominance of more aggressive tumor subtypes among the cell lines. We provide a cell line classification that establishes their relatedness to the major molecularly-defined bladder tumor subtypes. The compiled information should serve as a useful reference to the bladder cancer research community and should help to select cell lines appropriate for the functional analysis of bladder cancer genes, for example those being identified through massive parallel sequencing."

Deubiquitinating enzymes or isopeptidases can potentially prevent targeted destruction of protein substrates through deubiquitination prior to proteasomal degradation. However, only one deubiquitinating enzyme to date has been matched to a specific substrate in mammalian cells and shown to functionally modify it. Here we show that the isopeptidase USP2a (ubiquitin-specific protease-2a) interacts with and stabilizes fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is often overexpressed in biologically aggressive human tumors. Further, USP2a is androgen-regulated and overexpressed in prostate cancer, and its functional inactivation results in decreased FAS protein and enhanced apoptosis. Thus, the isopeptidase USP2a plays a critical role in prostate cancer cell survival through FAS stabilization and represents a therapeutic target in prostate cancer."

MMP-9 in the plasma membrane and the secreted forms are thought to contribute to the invasive and metastatic properties of malignant tumors. We have manipulated the expression of MMP-9 in prostate tumor cell line LNCaP and measured their capacity to invade through a basement membrane matrix. Stable expression of human MMP-9 in a poorly metastatic LNCaP prostate cancer cell line produced a 2-3-fold increase in MMP-9 activity and a comparable increase in invasiveness. Transient transfection of LNCaP stable clone expressing MMP-9 with MMP-9 antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) produced 55-90% less MMP-9 than control cells and were proportionately less invasive. In contrast, manipulating MMP-9 levels had no effect on cell migration across an uncoated membrane. A standard MMP-9 inhibitor at a concentration ranging from 1-10 nM, caused a nearly quantitative inhibition of extracellular MMP-9 activity and had significant effect on basement membrane invasion. Collectively, these results confirm the role of MMP-9 in tissue remodeling associated with prostate tumor invasion."

Here, we have investigated the effects of the antiinflammatory agent indomethacin on the invasion and metabolism of the human breast cancer cell line MDAMB-435 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles (DME)-based or Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-based cell medium, using a magnetic resonance-compatible invasion assay. Indomethacin treatment significantly reduced the invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells independent of the culture and perfusion conditions examined. Significant changes were detected in levels of intracellular choline phospholipid metabolites and in triglyceride (TG) concentrations of these cells, depending on indomethacin treatment and basal cell medium used. Additionally, genetic profiling of breast cancer cells, grown and treated with low-dose indomethacin in cell culture using an RPMI-based medium, revealed the upregulation of several genes implicating cyclooxygenaseindependent targets of indomethacin. These data confirm the ability of an anti-inflammatory agent to reduce breast cancer invasion and demonstrate, depending on cell culture and perfusion conditions, that the indomethacin-induced decrease in invasion is associated with changes in choline phospholipid metabolism, TG metabolism, and gene expression."

We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 targets a select pool of NCOR1-bound, transcriptionally-inactive AR for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting expression of select AR target genes implicated in lipid metabolism, cell motility, and proliferation. Siah2 is required for prostate cancer cell growth under androgen-deprivation conditions in vitro and in vivo, and Siah2 inhibition promotes prostate cancer regression upon castration. Notably, Siah2 expression is markedly increased in human CRPCs. Collectively, we find that selective regulation of AR transcriptional activity by the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 is important for CRPC development. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

METHODS: Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) analysis, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and RT-PCR methods were used respectively to determine the killing effects of OM and its influence on cell cycle distribution, telomerase activity and the expressions of hTERT, c-myc, p53 and mad1 in SW1116 cells. RESULTS: Oxymatrine exhibited dose-dependent killing effects on SW1116 cells and induced G1/G0-phase arrest. It suppressed the telomerase activity of the cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After OM administration, the expression of hTERT in the SW1116 cells decreased, those of p53 and mad1 increased, and the expression of c-myc was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Oxymatrine has dose-dependent killing effects on SW1116 cells and its antineoplastic activity might be attributed to inhibition of telomerase activity by means of its effects on hTERT and the upstream regulating genes."

COX-2 transfected MCF7 cells were able to generate long-term tumorospheres culture, even though transfection efficiency was only one in a million cells. We detected expression of OCT4 in some COX-2high cells, supporting the hypothesis that these cells could be cancer stem-like cells. It is important that COX-2high cells showed less expression of Ki-67 than did neighboring cells, indicating that COX-2high cells may be progenitors of tumorospheres. Celecoxib inhibited the growth of tumorosphere cultures and the ability of tumorosphere-derived cells to form colonies in vitro, indicating an active role of COX-2 in these processes. However, 2 ??M celecoxib failed to eradicate tumorosphere-initiating cells. Finally, we detected rare COX-2high cells among SUM149 inflammatory breast cancer cells growing on plastic in serum-containing medium; the SUM149 cell line produces a very high level of COX-2 protein. Conclusion: Our results support a role for COX-2 in stem-like breast cancer cells and suggest a mechanism behind a role for COX-2 in disseminated tumor cells, which are known to exhibit characteristic biomarkers and functional properties of stem-like cells. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Here we identify URI, which encodes a mitochondrial inhibitor of PP1?? and PP1??-mediated feedback inhibition of S6K1-BAD survival signaling, as an oncogene amplified and overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and human ovarian carcinomas. URI is an \" addicting\" oncogene selectively required for the survival of ovarian cancer cells with increased URI copy number. By constitutively detaining PP1?? in inactive complexes, URI sustains S6K1 survival signaling under growth factor-limiting conditions and mediates resistance of cells to cisplatin. Thus, oncogenic activation of URI defines an important mechanism for activating mitochondrial S6K1-BAD signaling and promoting cell survival through disabling PP1??-dependent negative feedback inhibition. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "The IGROVCDDP cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line is also resistant to paclitaxel and models the resistance phenotype of relapsed ovarian cancer patients after first-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy. A TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) was used to characterise the expression of 380 genes associated with chemotherapy resistance in IGROVCDDP cells. Paclitaxel resistance in IGROVCDDP is mediated by gene and protein overexpression of P-glycoprotein and the protein is functionally active. Cisplatin resistance was not reversed by elacridar, confirming that cisplatin is not a P-glycoprotein substrate. Cisplatin resistance in IGROVCDDP is multifactorial and is mediated in part by the glutathione pathway and decreased accumulation of drug. Total cellular glutathione was not increased. However, the enzyme activity of GSR and GGT1 were up-regulated. The cellular localisation of copper transporter CTR1 changed from membrane associated in IGROV-1 to cytoplasmic in IGROVCDDP. This may mediate the previously reported accumulation defect. There was decreased expression of the sodium potassium pump (ATP1A), MRP1 and FBP which all have been previously associated with platinum accumulation defects in platinum-resistant cell lines. Cellular localisation of MRP1 was also altered in IGROVCDDP shifting basolaterally, compared to IGROV-1. BRCA1 was also up-regulated at the gene and protein level. The overexpression of P-glycoprotein in a resistant model developed with cisplatin is unusual. This demonstrates that P-glycoprotein can be up-regulated as a generalised stress response rather than as a specific response to a substrate. Mechanisms characterised in IGROVCDDP cells may be applicable to relapsed ovarian cancer patients treated with frontline platinum/taxane chemotherapy."

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a devastating malignancy, characterized by intrinsic or acquired resistance to conventional chemotherapies. Recent evidences suggest an involvement of tyrosine kinase pathway in the regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) protein gene expression. The aim of this study was to test whether gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor could regulate the MDR protein gene expression and sensitize the resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. The gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and PGP) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, and expression levels of various tyrosine kinases were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot in pancreatic cancer cell line. MTT assay was used for evaluating the effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutics induced drug resistance by regulating the gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3), and increased the gene expression of RAF1/ERK and the phosphorylation of ERK in pancreatic cancer Bxpc-3 cells. Gefitinib caused an inhibition of p-ERK tyrosine kinase activation in a dose-dependent manner, and reversed gemcitabine-induced RAF1/ERK gene expression and p-ERK activation. In addition, a reversal of MDR proteins gene expression was achieved by gefitinib, which sensitized resistant cells to gemcitabine. This study demonstrated that MDR of Bxpc-3 cell is involved in the RAF1/ERK tyrosine kinase pathway. Gefitinib reverses the MDR protein gene expression and restores sensitivity of resistant cells to gemcitabine via RAF1/ERK signaling pathway. Combination of gefitinib with conventional chemotherapeutic agents may offer a new approach for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer."

        "abstract": "Amplification of chromosomal DNA is thought to be one of the mechanisms that activates cancer-related genes in tumors. In a previous genome-wide screening of DNA copy number aberrations in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines using an in-house bacterial artificial chromosome-based array, we identified a novel amplification at 14q11.2 in HUT29 cells derived from human lung adenocarcinoma. To identify the most likely target for the 14q11.2 amplification, we determined the extent of the amplicon by fluorescence in situ hybridization and then analyzed NSCLC cell lines for the expression levels of 28 genes present within the 1-Mb amplified region. Significant overexpression in the HUT29 cell line with amplification, relatively frequent overexpression in additional NSCLC cell lines compared with an immortalized normal lung epithelial cell line, and reported information about the function of each candidate gene prompted us to characterize the BCL2-like2 (BCL2L2) gene, a prosurvival member of the BCL2 family, as the most likely target for the 14q11.2 amplicon. Immunohistochemical analysis of 61 primary cases of lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated that BCL2L2 overexpression was significantly associated with tumor stage and differentiation status, and tended to be associated with a poorer prognosis. Downregulation of BCL2L2 expression using small interfering RNA dramatically inhibited the growth of HUT29 cells, but showed no effect on anticancer reagent-induced cell death of the same cell line. These findings demonstrate that overexpressed BCL2L2, through amplification or other mechanisms, promotes the growth of NSCLC, especially the adenocarcinoma subtype, and might be a therapeutic target."

In this study, we found that Snail is stabilized by the inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha through the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. We demonstrated that NF-kappaB is required for the induction of COP9 signalosome 2 (CSN2), which, in turn, blocks the ubiquitination and degradation of Snail. Furthermore, we showed that the expression of Snail correlated with the activation of NF-kappaB in cancer cell lines and metastatic tumor samples. Knockdown of Snail expression inhibited cell migration and invasion induced by inflammatory cytokines and suppressed inflammation-mediated breast cancer metastasis. Our study provides a plausible mechanism for inflammation-induced metastasis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) are mediated at the transcriptional level by retinoic acid receptors (RAR). These proteins are part of a superfamily of transcription factors which activate target gene expression when bound to their respective ligands. In addition to ligand binding, heterodimerization with transcriptional cofactors and posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation are also critical for transactivation function. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of a serine residue at amino acid 77 in the RARalpha amino terminus was required for basal activation function of the transcription factor. RESULTS: We have determined that RA inhibits cyclin H and cdk7 expression thereby decreasing levels of phosphorylated RARalpha in human cancer cell lines. To determine the effects of decreased RARalpha phosphorylation in human cancer cells, we stably transfected a phosphorylation defective mutant RARalpha expression construct into SCC25 cultures. Cells expressing the mutant RARalpha proliferated more slowly than control clones. This decreased proliferation was associated with increased cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor expression and decreased S phase entry. In the absence of ligand, the RARalpha mutant inhibited AP-1 activity to an extent similar to that of RA treated control clones. Levels of some AP-1 proteins were inhibited due to decreased EGFR expression upstream in the signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that hypophosphorylated RARalpha can mimic the anti-AP-1 effects of RA in the absence of ligand."

        "abstract": "Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been associated with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Irinotecan (CPT-11), a DNA topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, has been recently incorporated to the adjuvant therapy. Since the DNA-damage checkpoint depends on p53 activation, the status of p53 might critically influence the response to CPT-11. We analysed the sensitivity to CPT-11 in the human colon cancer cell line HT29 (mut p53) and its wild-type (wt)-p53 stably transfected subclone HT29-A4. Cell-cycle analysis in synchronised cells demonstrated the activation of transfected wt-p53 and a p21WAF1/CIP1-dependent cell-cycle blockage in the S phase. Activated wt-p53 increased apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to CPT-11. In p53-deficient cells, cDNA-macroarray analysis and western blotting showed an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1/cyclin B complex. Subsequent p53-independent activation of the cdk-inhibitor (cdk-I) p21WAF1/CIP1 prevented cell-cycle progression. Cdk1 induction was exploited in vivo to improve the sensitivity to CPT-11 by additional treatment with the cdk-I CYC-202. We demonstrate a gain of sensitivity to CPT-11 in a p53-mutated colon cancer model either by restoring wild-type p53 function or by sequential treatment with cdk-Is. Considering that mutations in p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC, a therapeutic approach specifically targeting p53-deficient tumors could greatly improve the treatment outcomes."

We characterized a HER-2-positive carcinoma cell line (JIMT-1) derived from a 62-year-old breast cancer patient which was clinically resistant to trastuzumab. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a complex hyperdiploid karyotype with numerous marker chromosomes and unbalanced translocations. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed numerous regions of copy number aberration (CNA). Further analysis by array CGH identified 27 regions of CNA (16 amplified, 11 deleted). Thirty-eight percent of the genes in the amplified regions were overexpressed, compared to only 9% in regions of normal copy number ratios (CNR). Accordingly, 26% of the genes in the deleted regions were underexpressed, compared to 10% in regions of normal CNR. Most amplified and overexpressed genes were located on chromosome 1 as well as on 8q, 12q14.1, 17q11 approximately q21, and 20q13. In 17q11 approximately q21, we identified two separate amplicons, the HER-2 amplicon and a previously unreported amplicon at 17q21.31. Several aberrant genes are implicated in cancer development (e.g., JUN, CDK4, and SLUG protooncogenes, as well as the drug/hormone-metabolizing genes GSTM1 and CYP24).

Much progress has been made in defining gene defects in pancreatic cancer, but a full accounting of its molecular pathogenesis remains to be provided. Here, we show that expression of the ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene (ATDC), also called TRIM29, is elevated in most invasive pancreatic cancers and pancreatic cancer precursor lesions. ATDC promoted cancer cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. ATDC expression correlated with elevated beta-catenin levels in pancreatic cancer, and beta-catenin function was required for ATDC's oncogenic effects. ATDC was found to stabilize beta-catenin via ATDC-induced effects on the Disheveled-2 protein, a negative regulator of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway."

        "abstract": "A small-molecule mimetic of Smac/Diablo that specifically counters the apoptosis-inhibiting activity of IAP proteins has been shown to enhance apoptosis induced by cell surface death receptors as well as chemotherapeutic drugs. Survey of a panel of 50 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines has revealed, surprisingly, that roughly one-quarter of these lines are sensitive to the treatment of Smac mimetic alone, suggesting that an apoptotic signal has been turned on in these cells and is held in check by IAP proteins. This signal has now been identified as the autocrine-secreted cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). In response to autocrine TNF\u03b1 signaling, the Smac mimetic promotes formation of a RIPK1-dependent caspase-8-activating complex, leading to apoptosis. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Previous preclinical and clinical findings have suggested a potential role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in osteoclast differentiation and the pathogenesis of bone metastasis in cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of erlotinib, an orally active EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), on the bone invasion of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line NCI-H292. First, we established a novel osteolytic bone invasion model of NCI-H292 cells which was made by inoculating cancer cells into the tibia of scid mice. In this model, NCI-H292 cells markedly activated osteoclasts in tibia, which resulted in osteolytic bone destruction. Erlotinib treatment suppressed osteoclast activation to the basal level through suppressing receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteoblast/stromal cell at the bone metastatic sites, which leads to inhibition of osteolytic bone destruction caused by NCI-H292 cells. Erlotinib inhibited the proliferation of NCI-H292 cells in in vitro. Erlotinib suppressed the production of osteolytic factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), IL-8, IL-11 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in NCI-H292 cells. Furthermore, erlotinib also inhibited osteoblast/stromal cell proliferation in vitro and the development of osteoclasts induced by RANKL in vitro. In conclusion, erlotinib inhibits tumor-induced osteolytic invasion in bone metastasis by suppressing osteoclast activation through inhibiting tumor growth at the bone metastatic sites, osteolytic factor production in tumor cells, osteoblast/stromal cell proliferation and osteoclast differentiation from mouse bone marrow cells."

        "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) has shown promising activity preclinically and clinically. Because comparative investigations of drug-resistant sublines with their parental cells are useful approaches to identifying the mechanism of gefitinib resistance and select factors that determine sensitivity to gefitinib, we established a human non-small cell lung carcinoma subline (PC-9/ZD) that is resistant to gefitinib. PC-9/ZD cells are approximately 180-fold more resistant to gefitinib than their parental PC-9 cells and PC-9/ZD cells do not exhibit cross-resistance to conventional anticancer agents or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, except AG-1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR. PC-9/ZD cells also display significant resistance to gefitinib in a tumor-bearing animal model. To elucidate the mechanism of resistance, we characterized PC-9/ZD cells. The basal level of EGFR in PC-9 and PC-9/ZD cells was comparable. A deletion mutation was identified within the kinase domain of EGFR in both PC-9 and PC-9/ZD, but no difference in the sequence of EGFR cDNA was detected in either cell line. Increased EGFR/HER2 (and EGFR/HER3) heterodimer formations were demonstrated in PC-9/ZD cells by chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis in cells unexposed to gefitinib. Exposure to gefitinib increased heterodimer formation in PC-9 cells, but not in PC-9/ZD cells. Gefitinib inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in PC-9 cells but not in PC-9/ZD cells. A marked difference in inhibition of site-specific phosphorylation of EGFR was observed at Tyr1068 compared to other tyrosine residues (Tyr845, 992 and 1045). To elucidate the downstream signaling in the PC9/ZD cellular machinery, complex formation between EGFR and its adaptor proteins GRB2, SOS, and Shc was examined. A marked reduction in the GRB2-EGFR complex and absence of SOS-EGFR were observed in PC-9/ZD cells, even though the protein levels of GRB2 and SOS in PC-9 and PC-9/ZD cells were comparable. Expression of phosphorylated AKT was increased in PC-9 cells and inhibited by 0.02 microM gefitinib. But the inhibition was not significant in PC-9/ZD cells. These results suggest that alterations of adaptor-protein-mediated signal transduction from EGFR to AKT is a possible mechanism of the resistance to gefitinib in PC-9/ZD cells. These phenotypes including EGFR-SOS complex and heterodimer formation of HER family members are potential biomarkers for predicting resistance to gefitinib."

In this study, we reported that N(6)-isopentenyladenosine inhibited the proliferation and promotes apoptosis in DLD1 human colon cancer cells. It suppressed the proliferation of cells through inhibition of DNA synthesis, causing a cell cycle arrest that correlated with a decrease in the levels of cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin D1 and with a concomitant increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf and p27kip1. Moreover, it induced apoptosis through an increase in the number of annexin V-positive cells, a downregulation of antiapoptotic products and caspase-3 activation. The apoptotic effects of N(6)-isopentenyladenosine were accompanied by sustained phosphorylation and activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that induced phosphorylation of c-jun. Overall, our data show that JNK, could play an important role in i6A-mediated apoptosis in DLD1 human colon cancer cells."

Methods: Here we studied the murine breast cancer cell line 66cl-4, because these cells are highly aggressive, potent inducers of metastasis and estrogen receptor negative. Results: We found that 200 mM methyl sulfone did not induce apoptosis in cancerous cells but instead decreased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, inhibited migration of cells through an extracellular matrix and induced contact inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth. Methyl sulfone promoted proper wound healing, reversed the epithelial to mesenchymal transition associated with metastatic disease and increased expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a differentiation protein of breast myoepithelial cells. Conclusion: Methyl sulfone did not kill the cancer cells but instead decreased metastatic phenotypes and increased normal differentiated phenotypes."

To elucidate the functions of CARM1 in tumorigenesis, we knocked out CARM1 from several breast cancer cell lines using Zinc-Finger Nuclease technology, which resulted in drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes. The CARM1 KO cell lines enabled identification of CARM1 substrates, notably the SWI/SNF core subunit BAF155. Methylation of BAF155 at R1064 was found to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell migration and metastasis. Furthermore, CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation affects gene expression by directing methylated BAF155 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., c-Myc pathway genes). Collectively, our studies uncover a mechanism by which BAF155 acquires tumorigenic functions via arginine methylation. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc."

In addition, it is an aggressive malignancy with a propensity for local progression and distant dissemination. Because of the poor long-term prognosis for patients with esophageal cancer, increasing attention has focused on the integration of targeted agents into current therapeutics. Nevertheless, there have been few studies reported concerning the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel-conjugated polymeric micelles in human esophageal cancer in vivo. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the tumor inhibition effect of composite micelles containing folic acid and paclitaxel on the human esophageal EC9706 cancer cell line.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Intravenous administration of folate-targeted, paclitaxel-loaded micelles was demonstrated to be more efficient in inhibiting subcutaneous xenograft tumors and extending the survival rate of tumor-bearing nude mice than free paclitaxel and plain paclitaxel micelles at an equivalent paclitaxel dose of 20 mg/kg, which was further backed up by flow cytometry, TUNEL, and expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3 in this study.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The folate-mediated paclitaxel-loaded polymeric micelle is a promising agent for the treatment of human esophageal cancer."

        "abstract": "Cell culture metabolomics has demonstrated significant advantages in cancer research. However, its applications have been impeded by some influencing factors such as culture media, which could significantly affect cellular metabolic profiles and lead to inaccuracy and unreliability of comparative metabolomic analysis of cells. To evaluate the effects of different culture media on cellular metabolic profiling, we performed NMR-based metabolomic analysis of the human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 cultured in both RPMI1640 and DMEM. We found that SGC7901 cultured in the two media exhibited distinct metabolic profiles with obviously different levels of discrepant metabolites, even though they showed almost the same cellular morphology and proliferation rates. When SGC7901 originally cultured in RPMI1640 was gradually acclimated in DMEM, both the metabolic profiles and most of the discrepant metabolite levels gradually converged toward those of the cells originally cultured in DMEM without significantly altered cell proliferation rates. However, several metabolite levels did not show the converging trends. Our results indicate that the effects of culture media on metabolic profiling must be carefully taken into account for comparative metabolomic analysis of cell lines. This work may be of benefit to the development of cell culture metabolomics."

IL-8 levels have been revealed to correlate significantly with the adhesion, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. However, whether IL-8 influences cell proliferation in gastric cancer remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of IL-8 on the proliferation of the SGC7901 human gastric cancer cell line was investigated. SGC7901 cells were exposed to various concentrations of IL-8 (0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1 ng/ml) for one to seven days. Cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. In addition, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein and mRNA levels were measured by immunofluorescence, western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Following exposure of SGC7901 cells to the various concentrations of IL-8, no significant changes in terms of cell proliferation were identified. However, IL-8 was shown to regulate PCNA protein and mRNA expression levels; at a concentration of 0.8 ng/ml, IL-8 significantly elevated the PCNA protein and mRNA expression levels, whereas IL-8 significantly inhibited these levels at other concentrations, compared with no treatment. In conclusion, IL-8 does not affect the proliferation of SGC7901 cells. However, IL-8 dosage was associated with PCNA protein and mRNA expression levels."

        "abstract": "Introduction & Objectives: Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen used for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. The DES effects are presumed secondary to suppression of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor stimulation of pituitary gland. DES has also direct anticancer activities. Its action is independent from the estrogen receptors and is preserved after a first line hormonotherapy treatment. By using 2-Dimensional-Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), we presented the expression variations of 14 proteins in the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1 after DES exposure. Our objective was to study the action of DES on the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1 by using a complementary quantitative proteomic approach by isobaric tagging iTRAQ followed by an assessment of variations of the identified protein of interest by RT-PCR. Materials & Methods: The prostate cancer 22RV1 cells were exposed to standard and DES (10 and 20 \u03bcM) enriched medium. After extraction, trypsine digestion and iTRAQ labeling, peptides were fractionated using offgel expression levels. Each iTRAQ set was analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight (MALDITOF/ TOF) mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed by iQuantitator. RNA was also extracted and quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Sybr Green chemistry. Results: After proteomic analysis, 895 constitutive proteins of the 22RV1 proteome were identified. Among these proteins, 66 had a modified expression due to DES exposure (23 over-expressed, 46 under-expressed). Most of them were implicated in apoptosis and redox processes and had a mitochondrial expression. Gene expression analysis confirmed that there estrogens receptors ER1 and ER2 were not expressed in our model. We assessed by RT-PCR the expression of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), Heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) and Insulinlike growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFB2), which are implicated in natural history of PCa. Their expression was changed by DES exposure according to proteomic analysis. These analyses confirmed the over-expression of OAT (p=0.006) and HSBP1 (p=0.046). However, the variation of IGFB2 was contradictory (it was over-expressed according to iTRAQ analysis and under-expressed according to RT-PCR (p=0,011)), suggesting that DES exerts both transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects on 22RV1 cells. Conclusions: The proteomic complementary approach by 2D-DIGE method and iTRAQ analysis allowed identifying 67 proteins with an expression variation depending on the presence of DES. Among them, several mitochondrial proteins were identified. Thus a hypothesis on the apoptosis consecutive to an oxidative stress induced by DES can be formulated. The over expression of OAT and HSBP1 has been confirmed by genomic and proteomic analysis."

It resembles the protooncogene Src structurally but lacks an amino-terminal myristylation site and localizes to the nuclear and perinuclear regions of the cell. We report here that expression of Rak in 2 different breast cancer cell lines inhibits growth and causes G(1) arrest of the cell cycle. This growth inhibition is kinase-dependent but does not require the Rak SH2 or SH3 domain. Rak also binds to the pRb tumor-suppressor protein but inhibits growth even in cells that lack pRb. These results suggest that Rak regulates cell growth by phosphorylating perinuclear proteins and has a function that is distinct from the Src-related kinase family."

In bladder, another organ of endodermal origin, we find that despite its initial presence in the cancer cell of origin Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression is invariably lost during progression to invasive urothelial carcinoma. Genetic blockade of stromal response to Shh furthermore dramatically accelerates progression and decreases survival time. This cancer-restraining effect of Hh pathway activity is associated with stromal expression of BMP signals, which stimulate urothelial differentiation. Progression is dramatically reduced by pharmacological activation of BMP pathway activity with low-dose FK506, suggesting an approach to management of human bladder cancer."

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway occurs frequently in human cancer. PTEN tumor suppressor or PIK3CA oncogene mutations both direct PI3K-dependent tumorigenesis largely through activation of the AKT/PKB kinase. However, here we show through phosphoprotein profiling and functional genomic studies that many PIK3CA mutant cancer cell lines and human breast tumors exhibit only minimal AKT activation and a diminished reliance on AKT for anchorage-independent growth. Instead, these cells retain robust PDK1 activation and membrane localization and exhibit dependency on the PDK1 substrate SGK3. SGK3 undergoes PI3K- and PDK1-dependent activation in PIK3CA mutant cancer cells. Thus, PI3K may promote cancer through both AKT-dependent and AKT-independent mechanisms. Knowledge of differential PI3K/PDK1 signaling could inform rational therapeutics in cancers harboring PIK3CA mutations. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We identify prostate-derived ETS factor (PDEF) as a mediator of mammary luminal epithelial lineage-specific gene expression and as a factor required for tumorigenesis in a subset of breast cancers. PDEF levels strongly correlate with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive luminal breast cancer, and PDEF transcription is inversely regulated by ER and GATA3. Furthermore, PDEF is essential for luminal breast cancer cell survival and is required in models of endocrine resistance. These results offer insights into the function of this ETS factor that are clinically relevant and may be of therapeutic value for patients with breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

The present study attempted to clarify that curcumin and triptolide synergistically suppress ovarian cancer cell growth in vitro. METHODS: To test synergic effects, cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed after curcumin and triptolide combination treatment on ovarian cancer cell lines. Synergistic effects on apoptosis induction were determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss assay and flow cytometry analysis. Critical regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis related were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: We showed that the combination of curcumin and triptolide could synergistically inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth, and induce apoptosis, which is accompanied by HSP27 and HSP70, indicating that HSP27 and HSP70 play the important role in the synergic effect. CONCLUSIONS: From the result present here, curcumin and triptolide combination with lower concentration have a synergistic anti-tumor effect on ovarian cancer and which will have a good potential in clinical applications."

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains a leading cause of death despite its relatively low incidence. As in many other solid tumors, angiogenesis is critical to the growth and metastasis of this cancer. Through serial in vivo passages in mice, we have developed a highly aggressive variant of human pancreatic cancer cell line XPA-1 which shows more rapid primary tumor growth, faster time to metastasis, and more rapid lethality than the parental cell line. The high-metastatic variant developed a much denser tumor vasculature early during growth within the pancreas. Interestingly, examination of the in vitro growth of this aggressive variant yielded no significant difference from the parental cell line. Real-time PCR evaluation of genes involved in angiogenesis revealed a 24-fold increase in Thrombospondin-1 expression in cells derived from the high-metastatic variant when compared with the parental cell line. These findings provide direct evidence that elevated capability for angiogenesis, mediated by specific changes in gene expression, can lead to a large increase in cancer aggressiveness and resulting metastasis. These findings have important implications for the treatment of metastatic disease."

However, whether cancer cell-derived exosomes regulate the migration and invasion of the cancer cell itself, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, exosomes derived from the 786-0 human renal cancer cell line were isolated, purified and 100 \u03bcg/ml were co-cultured with 786-0 cells for 24 h. The 786-0 cells were harvested for a cell invasion and migration assay. The expression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the 786-0 cells was examined by western blot analysis and revealed that the migration and invasion capabilities of the 786-0 cells were increased, however, the cell adhesion abilities were decreased as a result of the 24-h treatment with 786-0-derived exosomes. Furthermore, the expression levels of CXCR4 and MMP-9 in the 786-0 cells were increased. In conclusion, the 786-0 renal cancer cell line-derived exosomes increased migration and invasion, however, they decreased the adhesion ability of the 786-0 cells. The exosomes may have increased the CXCR4 and MMP-9 expression levels in the 786-0 cells. These findings indicated that renal tumor-derived exosomes may contribute to renal cancer development and progression."

In tumors, placental-like CS chains are linked to a limited repertoire of cancer-associated proteoglycans including CD44 and CSPG4. The rVAR2 protein localizes to tumors in vivo and rVAR2 fused to diphtheria toxin or conjugated to hemiasterlin compounds strongly inhibits in vivo tumor cell growth and metastasis.

        "abstract": "Aberrant promoter hypermethylation and associated gene silencing are epigenetic hallmarks of tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that aberrant DNA methylation can affect the sensitivity of cancers to antineoplastic agents by altering expression of genes critical to drug response. To study this issue, we used bisulfite PCR to assess DNA methylation of 32 promoter-associated CpG islands in human cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug-screening panel (NCI-60 panel). The frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of these islands ranged from 2% to 81% in NCI-60 cancer cells, and provided a database that can be analyzed for the sensitivity to approximately 30,000 drugs tested in this panel. By correlating drug activity with DNA methylation, we identified a list of methylation markers that predict sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Among them, hypermethylation of the p53 homologue p73 and associated gene silencing was strongly correlated with sensitivity to alkylating agents. We used small interfering RNA to down-regulate p73 expression in multiple cell lines, including the resistant cell lines TK10 (renal cancer) and SKMEL28 (melanoma). Down-regulating p73 substantially increased sensitivity to commonly used alkylating agents, including cisplatin, indicating that epigenetic silencing of p73 directly modulates drug sensitivity. Our results confirm that epigenetic profiles are useful in identifying molecular mediators for cancer drug sensitivity (pharmaco-epigenomics)."

In this paper we show using a tet-on gene expression system that over-expression of cofilin inhibits the invasiveness of human lung cancer H1299 cells. Over-expressed cofilin disrupts the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge of the cell and up-regulates p27kip1, which is known to be involved in regulating cell motility. Removal of cofilin over-expression normalizes the p27kip1 level and concomitantly restores the invasiveness of the cultured cells. These findings suggest that excessive cofilin production might prevent cancer cell invasion. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Federation for Cell Biology."

        "abstract": "Genuine racial differences in prostate cancer (PCa) biology have been considered among the potential reasons to explain PCa disparities. There is no animal model to represent all aspects of human PCa and, more specifically, to be used for PCa disparity research. The lack of a spontaneously transformed in vitro cell-based model system has been a significant impediment to investigating and understanding potential molecular mechanisms, and the hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic factors underlying the biological and clinical aggressiveness of PCa in African American (AA) men. In this study, we established and characterized the E006AA-hT cell line as a highly tumorigenic subline of the previously characterized primary AA-PCa cell line, E006AA. Extensive characterization of the E006AA-hT cell line was accomplished using cytodifferentiation and prostate-specific markers, spectral karyotyping, cell line authentication assays, cell proliferation and migration assays, and in vitro tumorigenesis assays. Spectral karyotyping of E006AA-hT showed a hypertriploid chromosome complement and shared cytogenetic changes similar to its parental cells such as diploid X, absence of Y-chromosomes, numerical gains in chromosomes 5,6,8,10,17,20,21, and marker chromosomes of unknown origin. In addition, E006AA-hT also presented numerous clonal and structural aberrations such as insertion, deletion, duplication, and translocations in chromosomes 1-5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18. The E006AA-hT cell line was shown to be highly tumorigenic and produced tumors at an accelerated growth rate in both athymic nude and triple-deficient SCID mice. Silencing the mutated androgen receptor (AR-599 Ser>Gly) did not affect proliferation (loss-of-function), but decreased migration (gain-of-function) in E006AA-hT and its parental cell type. These data support that AR-point mutations may lead simultaneously to different \"loss-of-function\" and \"gain-of-function\" phenotypes in PCa cells. E006AA-Par and its subline as the only available spontaneously transformed low- and highly-tumorigenic primary AA-PCa cell lines could be used for basic and translational research aimed in supporting prostate cancer disparity research."

The structure of pectins, which depends on the extraction method, is decisive in their capacity to induce apoptosis on several cancer cell lines like colon, prostate and breast. In this work, sugar beet pectin extraction was performed in the following steps: lipid extraction with hexane, removal of soluble complex carbohydrates and proteins, and enzymatic treatment with amyloglucosidase, protease, and pectinase. The enzymatic treatment was carried out with Rohapect DA6L under the following conditions: 50\u00b0C, pH 4.0, 2% enzyme/substrate (E/S) ratio, 15 h, and a solid to liquid ratio of 1: 10. The pectic extract showed a degree of polymerization (DP) profile of 55.8% with DP \u2265 7; 4.9% with DP6; 5.8% between DP2 and DP6; 4.7% with DP2; and 28.8% with DP1. The pectic extract was examined for its antiproliferative activity on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. At a concentration range of 12.5-25 mg/mL the pectic extract killed 80.6% of the cells, exhibiting a higher antiproliferative activity than 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), a classical anticancer drug, which killed 56.5% of the cells. \u00a9 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

        "abstract": "PTX1 is a gene identified by subtractive hybridization on the basis that it is expressed in normal prostate and not in prostate carcinoma. It encodes a nuclear protein that is downregulated in prostate carcinoma. Expression constructs containing PTX1 cDNA in both sense and antisense orientations were transfected into prostate tumor cell line, PC-3 cells. The effects of the expression of PTX1 and antisense PTX1 on PC-3 cells were examined using cell growth, proliferation, soft agar, invasion chamber, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, and nude mice assays. Cells transfected with PTX1 construct in the sense orientation were growth-arrested. These cells displayed multiple morphological changes consistent with cellular senescence, including the expression of a senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. On the other hand, expression of antisense PTX1 RNA in PC-3 cells resulted in uncontrolled cell growth and increase of invasive potential. In nude mice, cells expressing antisense PTX1 grew sixfold faster than the control. These results suggest that PTX1 may play an important role in the growth and tumorigenicity of PC-3 cells."

        "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is well established as having non-cholinergic functions and is also expressed in breast tumours where its function(s) is not known. Recently, a candidate peptide sequence towards the C-terminal of the AChE molecule has been identified, as the salient site remote from normal catalysis in neurons, and possibly other cells. The main aim of this study was to explore the possibility that 'AChE-peptide' might also affect human breast cancer cells. Uptake of the non-cytotoxic tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as an index of endocytosis, a key component of the metastatic cascade, representing exocytosis/secretory membrane activity and/or plasma membrane protein turnover. AChE-peptide had no affect on the weakly metastatic MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. By contrast, application of AChE-peptide to the strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HRP uptake; treatment with a scrambled variant of the peptide of comparable amino acid length was ineffective. The action of AChE-peptide was suppressed by lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and co-applying a selective antagonist of alpha7, but not alpha4/beta2, nicotinic receptor. The results suggest that AChE-peptide has a novel, selective bioactivity on breast cancer cells and can potentiate metastatic cell behaviour."

        "abstract": "The identification of mammary epithelial stem cells raises the hypothesis that these cells may be crucial in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. To further support this, a highly tumourigenic sub-population of cancer cells has recently been identified in primary and metastatic breast cancer samples. In this study, a sub-population of cells displaying features normally attributed to stem cells was identified within the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This sub-population is capable of growth in anchorage-independent conditions as spherical organoids, displays resistance to proapoptotic agents and significantly greater tumourigenicity than its parental line, with as few as 1,000 cells able to form tumours in immunodeficient mice. Cells within this sub-population can be enriched by serial passages in anchorage-independence, and are characterized by over-expression of the adhesion molecule alpha6-integrin. Alpha-6 integrin proves to be required for the growth and survival of these cells, as the knockdown of ITGA6 causes mammosphere-derived cells to lose their ability to grow as mammospheres and abrogates their tumourigenicity in mice. These findings support the existence of a highly tumourigenic sub-population in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, it shows alpha6-integrin as a potential therapeutic target aimed at tumour-generating subsets of breast cancer cells."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acquired or intrinsic drug resistance is one of the major handicaps in the success of chemotherapy. Etoposide is a topoisomerase II poison widely used in chemotherapy. Similar to other topoisomerase inhibitors and DNA damaging agents, resistance to etoposide may arise as a result of alterations in target expression and activity, increased drug efflux and alterations in DNA damage response mechanisms. Here, we tested the involvement of such mechanisms in etoposide-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: Relative etoposide resistance was determined by XTT cell proliferation assay. For gene expression analysis, total RNA was extracted from each cell line and gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR following reverse transcription. Topoisomerase II activities of each cell line were compared by using in vitro topoisomerase II activity assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: Etoposide-resistant sublines MCF-7/1E and MCF-7/4E are 2.6- and 4.6-fold more resistant to etoposide compared to parental cell line MCF-7/S. TOP2A, the gene encoding the topoisomerase II alpha, is significantly downregulated in drug resistant sublines while topoisomerase II activity seemed similar among cell lines. MRP1, which encodes an etoposide efflux pump, is significantly upregulated in etoposide-resistant sublines. Two DNA damage response proteins TOPBP1 and EDD were found to be downregulated in etoposide-resistant sublines.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light into the etoposide resistance in breast cancer by investigating previously proposed and novel factors that may have a role in development or progression of etoposide resistance which can be considered as diagnostic markers and therapy targets."

        "abstract": "To elucidate the mechanism of resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in human gastric cancer cells, we established a cell line MKN45/F2R, which acquired 5-FU resistance as a result of continuous exposure to increasing dosages of 5-FU over a year. The cell line showed 157-fold elevated 5-FU resistance compared to the MKN45 human gastric cancer parental cell line. Furthermore, the cells acquired crossresistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel. To identify the mechanism of 5-FU resistance, the expressions of 5-FU metabolic enzymes were examined. Although protein expression and activity of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase did not change, orotate phosphoribosyl-transferase (OPRT) protein expression and activity significantly decreased in the 5-FU resistant MKN45/F2R cells. Interestingly, expression of proteins related to taxane resistance including P-glycoprotein, class III beta-tubulin and Bcl-2 increased in MKN45/F2R cells. OPRT-knockout MKN45 parent cells using small interfering RNA demonstrated 15.8-fold increased resistance to 5-FU compared to the control cells. However, resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel was not observed. These results strongly indicate that decreased activity of OPRT plays an important role in the acquired resistance of gastric cancer cells towards 5-FU; however, it does not play a direct role in paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance. Further studies are now underway to identify genes related to crossresistance to these chemotherapeutic agents"

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the impact that fibroblasts have on cancer cell behavior in vivo has been limited by the complexities of in vivo tumor microenvironments, which contain many distinct cell populations that influence tumor growth and survival. Herein, we describe a novel, three-dimensional (3D), in vitro, fluorometric, Tumor Growth Assay (TGA) that allows for non-invasive measurements of cancer cell expansion in the presence of multiple tumor-associated cell types or soluble factors, while embedded in Cultrex\u00ae or Matrigel\u2122 Basement Membrane Extract (BME). Using this assay, we investigated the direct biological impact of primary human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSC) on the growth rates of a panel of metastatic breast cancer cell lines. Human MSC can be readily isolated from bone marrow, a principle site of breast cancer metastasis, and were found to significantly enhance the growth rate of MCF-7 (P-value < 0.0001), an estrogen receptor-alpha (ER\u03b1) positive breast cancer cell line, in a soluble factor-dependent manner. MSC paracrine factors also enhanced the growth of other ER\u03b1 positive breast cancer cell lines including T47D, BT474, and ZR-75-1 (P-value < 0.05). In contrast, the ER\u03b1 negative cell line MDA-MB-231 was unaffected by hMSC and the growth rate of another ER\u03b1 negative cell line MDA-MB-468 was elevated in the presence of hMSC, albeit to a lesser extent than MCF-7 or the other ER\u03b1 positive cell lines tested. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Short-tandem-repeat (STR) profiling (DNA fingerprinting) is the method of choice for this purpose; however, the genetic stability of cell lines under various experimental conditions is not well defined. We tested the effect of long-term culture, subcloning, and generation of drug-resistant subclones on fingerprinting profiles in four widely used leukemia cell lines. The DNA fingerprinting profile remained unaltered in two of them (U937 and K562) throughout 12 months in culture, and the vast majority of subclones derived therefrom by limiting dilution after long-term culture revealed the same profile, indicating a high degree of stability and clonotypic homogeneity. In contrast, two other cell lines (CCRF-CEM and Jurkat) showed marked alterations in DNA fingerprinting profiles during long-term culture. Limiting dilution subcloning revealed extensive clonotypic heterogeneity with subclones differing in up to eight STR loci from the parental culture. Similar heterogeneity was observed in subclones generated by selection culture for drug resistance where DNA fingerprinting proved useful in identifying possible resistance mechanisms. Thus, common tissue culture procedures may dramatically affect the fingerprinting profile of certain cell lines and thus render definition of their origin difficult."

However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to cisplatin is common, which severely limits its therapeutic potential. We determined the synergistic antitumor effect of cisplatin and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in cisplatin resistant human bladder cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cisplatin resistant human bladder cancer cell line T24R2 was exposed to cisplatin and/or trichostatin A. Tumor cell proliferation was examined by cell counting kit assay. Synergism between 2 drugs was examined by the combination index. Changes in cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. We analyzed the expression of caspase-3, 8 and 9, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, p21WAF1/CIP1, cyclin A, B1 and D1, Cdc2c, p-Cdc2c, Cdc25c, p-Cdc25c, cytochrome c, p-Akt, t-Akt, Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, vascular endothelial growth factor and fetal liver kinase-1 by Western blot and colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Based on the combination index and isobole analysis of the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay we observed a strong synergistic antitumor effect between cisplatin and trichostatin A, allowing a 3.5 and 4.9-fold dose reduction in cisplatin and trichostatin A, respectively, while achieving an estimated 90% kill of T24R2 cells. The underlying mechanism could be synergistic cell cycle arrest, induction of caspase mediated apoptosis or up-regulated expression of pro-apoptotic Bad and Bax. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that trichostatin A may synergistically enhance the antitumor effect of cisplatin and resensitize cisplatin resistant bladder cancer cells. These findings suggest the potential use of histone deacetylase inhibitor as a combination agent to enhance the antitumor effect of cisplatin in patients with advanced bladder cancer."

METHODS: Cells from the primary tumor were passaged in culture and genotyped as a unique cell line. The resultant cell line was assessed for its ability to replicate the primary tumor. RESULTS: The primary tumor and cell line contained 19.03% and 19.62% CD44(high) cells, respectively. CD44(high) cancer stem cells from UM-SCC-103 formed tumors after flank injections in mice that reconstituted the heterogeneity of the primary tumor. CD44 staining and histology in the primary tumor and tumors grown in vivo from the cell line were similar. CD44(high) cells from the primary tumor resulted in lung colony formation in 2 out of 2 tail vein injections in mice, whereas CD44(low) cells did not. Similarly, CD44(high) cells from UM-SCC-103 formed lung tumors in 2 out of 4 mice, whereas CD44(low) cells did not. CONCLUSION: The similarity in marker expression and tumorigenic behavior between the primary tumor and the resulting cell line strongly suggests that the cell line resembles the primary tumor that it was derived from and provides an important new research tool for the study of head and neck carcinomas in young patients."

Utilizing recent key technological advances in proteomics, particularly antibody array-based methodologies, the current study aimed to examine the benefit of protein expression profiling in an analogous molecular pharmacological context. We performed protein expression analysis in a panel of lung cancer cell lines via an antibody array approach. Using a modified NCI program, we related cell line-specific proteomic profiles to the previously determined cytotoxic activity of a selection of commonly used anticancer agents, namely docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), SN38, cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin (CBDCA). In addition, we compared these results with those obtained from our prior DNA microarray-based transcriptomic study. In our expression-drug correlation analysis using antibody array, gemcitabine consistently belonged to an isolated cluster. Docetaxel, paclitaxel, 5-FU, SN38, CBDCA and CDDP were gathered together into one large cluster. These results coincided with those generated by the prior transcriptomic study. Various genes were commonly listed that differentiated gemcitabine from the others. The identified factors associated with drug sensitivities were different between both analyses. Our proteomic profiling data provided confirmation of the previous transcript expression-drug sensitivity correlation analysis. These results suggest that chemotherapy regimens that include gemcitabine should be evaluated in second-line chemotherapy in cases where the first-line chemotherapy did not include this drug. Protein expression-drug sensitivity correlations in lung cancer cells in vitro may provide useful information in determining the most appropriate therapeutic options for lung cancer patients."

        "abstract": "Hyperactive PI3K/mTOR signaling is prevalent in human malignancies and its inhibition has potent antitumor consequences. Unfortunately, single-agent targeted cancer therapy is usually short-lived. We have discovered a JAK2/STAT5-evoked positive feedback loop that dampens the efficacy of PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Mechanistically, PI3K/mTOR inhibition increased IRS1-dependent activation of JAK2/STAT5 and secretion of IL-8 in several cell lines and primary breast tumors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of JAK2 abrogated this feedback loop and combined PI3K/mTOR and JAK2 inhibition synergistically reduced cancer cell number and tumor growth, decreased tumor seeding and metastasis, and also increased overall survival of the animals. Our results provide a rationale for combined targeting of the PI3K/mTOR and JAK2/STAT5 pathways in triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive and currently incurable disease. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc."

Toward this direction effort has been made to understand the anticancer activity of curcumin (cur) and genistein (gen) combination in human prostate cancer cell line (PC3) cells with respect to their antiangiogenic effect. Cur and gen has shown dose and time dependent decrease in cell viability, increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0 phase. These effects were more noticeable when cur (20\u2009\u00b5M) and gen (100\u2009\u03bcM) were used in combination. To understand antiangiogenic effect of this combination, expression of ARNT and HIF-1\u03b1 was studied. Significant decline in expression of ARNT and HIF-1\u03b1 protein level was seen in comparison to control group and their respective monotherapy treated groups. Cur and gen are shown to be effective in abrogating the VEGF production by evading ARNT and HIF-1\u03b1 complex formation as proved by immunoprecipitation assay. Thus this combination seems to be promising toward cancer treatment."

The YDOV-139 cell line was established using ascites samples from a 67-year-old Korean woman with recurrent ovarian cancer, and was characterized with respect to various biological and genetic features. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using cDNA microarrays, and proteomic evaluation was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight peptide mass fingerprinting (MALDI-TOF/PMF). Four candidate markers that were strongly up-regulated in YDOV-139 were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The epithelial-like characteristics of YDOV-139 were evident from morphologic studies, and the average population doubling time was 120 h. When transplanted into nude mice, YDOV-139 cells successfully induced tumor masses in all three animals. Chemosensitivity tests showed that gemcitabine had the highest chemosensitivity index against YDOV-139 cells. HLA typing revealed A*24/A*31, B*07/B*35, Cw03*(09)/w*07, and DRB1*01/DRB1*15 alleles. Compared with human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells, 2,520 genes and 23 protein spots were differentially expressed in YDOV-139. Validation by real-time PCR showed that mRNA expression of LCN2, MDK, SLCO4A1, and ER-60 (PDIA3) were strongly elevated in ovarian cancers. In IHC analysis, ER-60 (PDIA3) was significantly overexpressed in both borderline tumors and invasive ovarian cancers (P<0.001). The molecular characteristics of YDOV-139 may have implications for future ovarian cancer research and ER-60 (PDIA3) should be investigated further as a potential biomarker of ovarian cancer."

Preleukemic SPA-1-deficient mice revealed selective expansion of marrow pluripotential hematopoietic progenitors, which showed abnormal Rap1GTP accumulation. Overexpression of an active form of Rap1 promoted the proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors, while SPA-1 overexpression markedly suppressed it. Furthermore, restoring SPA-1 gene in a SPA-1-deficient leukemic blast cell line resulted in the dissolution of Rap1GTP accumulation and concomitant loss of the leukemogenicity in vivo. These results unveiled a role of Rap1 in myeloproliferative stem cell disorders and a tumor suppressor function of SPA-1."

        "abstract": "Abstract Diabetic patients have increased likelihood of developing breast cancer. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) underlie the pathogenesis of diabetic complications but their impact on breast cancer cells is not understood. This study aims to determine the effects of methylglyoxal-derived bovine serum albumin AGEs (MG-BSA-AGEs) on the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. By performing cell counting, using wound-healing assay, invasion assay and zymography analysis, we found that MG-BSA-AGEs increased MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration and invasion through Matrigel\u2122 associated with an enhancement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activities, in a dose-dependent manner. Using Western blot and flow cytometry analyses, we demonstrated that MG-BSA-AGEs increased expression of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and phosphorylation of key signaling protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2. Furthermore, in MG-BSA-AGE-treated cells, phospho-protein micro-array analysis revealed enhancement of phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein 70 serine S6 kinase beta 1 (p70S6K1), which is known to be involved in protein synthesis, the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, which are involved in cell survival. Blockade of MG-BSA-AGE/RAGE interactions using a neutralizing anti-RAGE antibody inhibited MG-BSA-AGE-induced MDA-MB-231 cell processes, including the activation of signaling pathways. Throughout the study, non-modified BSA had a negligible effect. In conclusion, AGEs might contribute to breast cancer development and progression partially through the regulation of MMP-9 activity and RAGE signal activation. The up-regulation of RAGE and the concomitant increased phosphorylation of p70S6K1 induced by AGEs may represent promising targets for drug therapy to treat diabetic patients with breast cancer."

Oncogenic mutants of PIK3CA (activator of the same pathway and frequently mutated in breast cancer) also conferred resistance to trastuzumab in cell culture. In a cohort of 55 breast cancer patients, activation of the PI3K pathway, as judged by the presence of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations or low PTEN expression, was associated with poor prognosis after trastuzumab therapy, and the combined analysis of PTEN and PIK3CA identified twice as many patients at increased risk for progression compared to PTEN alone. Thus, assessment of PI3K pathway activation may provide a biomarker to identify patients unlikely to respond to trastuzumab-based therapy. Author Keywords: CELLCYCLE   The mechanism by which trastuzumab exerts its antitumor activity is not fully understood. Trastuzumab has been suggested to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Clynes et al., 2000), inhibit HER2 extracellular domain cleavage (Molina et al., 2001), or inhibit PI3K/AKT survival signaling, either by downregulating HER2 signaling (Yakes et al., 2002) or by increasing PTEN membrane localization and phosphatase activity, leading to a decline in PI3K/AKT pathway activation and inhibition of proliferation (Nagata et al., 2004). In addition, activation of HER-related receptors, such as HER3, or non-HER receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor I receptor, have been suggested in preclinical studies to increase PI3K/AKT signaling thereby limiting trastuzumab efficacy ([Lu et al., 2001] and [Sergina et al., 2007]). In spite of this, it is still largely unclear why almost half of the breast cancer patients that overexpress HER2 are initially nonresponsive to trastuzumab-based therapy even when combined with chemotherapy or eventually become resistant to trastuzumab during treatment ([Cobleigh et al., 1999], [Slamon et al., 2001] and [Vogel et al., 2002]). An understanding of the resistance mechanisms would stimulate the development of rational drug combinations to circumvent resistance and allow better selection of patients likely to respond. As an unbiased approach to identify genes involved in trastuzumab resistance, we used a large-scale RNA interference genetic screen in the HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line BT-474. We have previously described the generation of a library of 24,000 shRNA retroviral vectors targeting some 8000 human genes for suppression by RNA interference as well as a technology to rapidly screen such libraries, named siRNA barcode screening ([Berns et al., 2004] and [Brummelkamp et al., 2006]). In short, this technology allows one to identify shRNAs that are enriched in a population based on the relative abundance of a \u201cbarcode\u201d identifier (a unique 19-mer DNA sequence) in the vector, which is measured on a DNA microarray that carries the 24,000 different barcode sequences. BT-474 cells respond to trastuzumab predominantly by a reduction in proliferation rate rather than apoptosis or complete proliferation arrest (Figure 1A). To identify genes whose suppression by shRNA cause resistance to trastuzumab, BT-474 cells were infected with the shRNA library and selected for the presence of the shRNA vectors with puromycin. After selection, cells were split into two populations and plated at low density. One population was left untreated and was used as a reference while the other was exposed to 10 \u03bcg/ml trastuzumab. After 4 weeks, cells were harvested, genomic DNA isolated, and shRNA cassettes were recovered by PCR amplification and hybridized to DNA microarrays as described (Berns et al., 2004) (Figure 1B). We combined the data from five independent trastuzumab barcode screens and analyzed the relative abundance of the recovered shRNAs. Figure 1C shows the relative abundance of the shRNA vectors in the trastuzumab-treated population as compared to the untreated population. We selected the top 5 shRNA vectors with the highest enrichment by trastuzumab selection (IDE, NBS1, PTEN, NRP1, and ZAP70), of which the shRNA targeting the PTEN tumor suppressor gene was most prominently enriched (marked with an arrow). When tested in second round selection, only the vector targeting PTEN conferred resistance to trastuzumab. Importantly, a second, independent shRNA knocking down PTEN expression (Kortlever et al., 2006) also conferred resistance to trastuzumab, effectively ruling out the possibility that \u201coff target\u201d effects of the shRNA vectors caused the resistance phenotype (Figure 2A). Our finding that knockdown of PTEN in BT-474 cells decreases sensitivity to trastuzumab is consistent with earlier findings which demonstrated that PTEN loss is associated with resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy (Nagata et al., 2004). Importantly, our observation that of the 8000 genes tested, only knockdown of PTEN conferred resistance to trastuzumab suggests that the PTEN pathway plays a dominant role in trastuzumab resistance. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that other factors were missed in our screen due to false negative results of the shRNA vectors. Since loss of PTEN is only observed in a fraction of breast cancers, it is unlikely that loss of PTEN alone explains the frequent primary and acquired nonresponsiveness to trastuzumab observed in the clinic. Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN or decreased PTEN expression result in hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway. Significantly, activating mutations in the gene encoding the p110\u03b1 catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) have been identified in some 25% of primary breast cancers potentially mimicking the effects of PTEN loss (Saal et al., 2005). The majority of these mutations reside in two hotspots in exon 9 and 20 and it has been demonstrated that the two most common mutations (E545K and H1047R) result in increased PI3K pathway signaling (Isakoff et al., 2005). To test whether activation of the PI3K pathway upstream of PTEN results in trastuzumab resistance, we retrovirally transduced BT-474 cells with a constitutively active mutant of PIK3CA, caPIK3CA (p110\u03b1CaaX). Figure 2A shows that expression of this mutant rendered BT-474 almost completely insensitive toward trastuzumab. Furthermore, expression of PIK3CA(WT) and the breast cancer-derived mutant PIK3CA(H1047R) also conferred resistance to trastuzumab in SK-BR3 cells (Figure 2B) and in BT-474 cells (data not shown). As expected, the oncogenic mutant displays higher PI3K activity than wild-type PIK3CA as measured by AKT S473 phosphorylation status (Figure 2C). However, a small increase in PI3K signaling through overexpression of PIK3CA(WT) is already sufficient to completely counteract the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab in cell culture as was further shown by analysis of the proliferation rates of BT474 cell lines expressing PIK3CA(WT) (Figure 2D). These findings are consistent with a major role of the PI3K pathway in the development of resistance to trastuzumab. The high frequency of activating mutations in PIK3CA (around 25%; Saal et al., 2005) in breast cancer, together with our observation that activated PI3K signaling induces strong trastuzumab resistance in cell culture, led us to investigate whether PI3K pathway activity, as assessed by cancer-associated mutations of PIK3CA or altered levels of PTEN, was able to predict trastuzumab resistance in the clinic. For this, we made use of samples from two series of HER2-overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer treated at the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital (n = 34) and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (n = 21). These 55 patients received trastuzumab monotherapy (n = 6), or trastuzumab in combination with a chemotherapy regimen (n = 49). Both the PTEN expression levels (using immunohistochemical analysis) and the PIK3CA mutation status (by direct sequencing or SNP-based analysis) were evaluated in this study and correlated to the therapeutic response to trastuzumab-based therapy (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). We observed reduced PTEN expression in 22% (11 out of 51; four samples could not be scored) of the tumors examined (Table S1). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated based on clinical follow-up data on time to progression after initiation of the trastuzumab-based treatment. Figure 3A shows that patients with PTEN low tumors have a somewhat worse progression-free survival, although this is not statistically significant (p = 0.127). Subsequent PIK3CA sequence analysis of the 55 tumor samples identified 10 mutations in exon 20 (H1047R) and 4 in exon 9 (E542K and E545K) corresponding to a PIK3CA mutation frequency of 25%, in agreement with the published frequency of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer (Saal et al., 2005; Table S1). Interestingly, 10 of 14 of the PIK3CA mutations were identified in PTEN high tumors (for three PIK3CA mutations PTEN data were missing), which is in agreement with the finding that PTEN loss and PIK3CA mutation are rarely present in the same tumor in breast cancer (Saal et al., 2005). Apparently, abrogation of either PTEN expression or oncogenic PIK3CA mutation relieves the selective pressure to target the other. We then determined whether activation of the"

Two papers now challenge both the concept that cyclin E/CDK2 is a requisite component of the cell cycle machine and efforts to develop cyclin E/CDK2 inhibitors as antiproliferative therapeutics."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of miRNA-32 (miR-32) on the biological behavior of the human gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901. SGC-7901 cells were transfected with miR-32-mimic, miR-32-inhibitor and empty plasmid vectors using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000. The expression of GFP was observed by fluorescent microscopy and miR-32 gene expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate the effect of miR-32 expression on cell proliferation in vitro. Alterations in the migration and metastatic potential of SGC-7901 cells, prior to and following miR-32 gene transfection, were assayed by cell chemotactic migration and invasion tests. The results of the current study showed that the proliferation rate of the transfected SGC-7901 cells overexpressing miR-32 is reduced and cell chemotactic migration and invasion potentials is markedly reduced following miR-32-mimic transfection (P<0.05). In addition, the results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-32 greatly inhibits the proliferation and decreases the migration and invasion capabilities of SGC-7901 cells in vitro."

However, the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer properties of Nigella sativa phytochemical extracts have not been completely understood. Our data showed that Nigella sativa extracts significantly inhibited human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at doses of 2.5-5 \u03bcg/mL (P<0.05). Apoptotic induction in MDA-MB-231 cells was observed in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to Nigella sativa extracts for 48 h. Real time PCR and flow cytometry analyses suggested that Nigella sativa extracts possess the ability to suppress the proliferation of human breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in many areas and is increasing found in developing countries, where the majority of cases are diagnosed in late stages. Retinoic acids, through their associated nuclear receptors, exert intoxicating effects on cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, and hold significant promise in relation to cancer therapy and chemoprevention. To enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with retinoic acids in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in a time-dependent manner, we conducted a proteomic analysis of MCF-7 cells using the 2-DE couple with high-throughput mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. In the 2-DE patterns of MCF-7 cells treated with retinoic acid in a time-dependent manner, 35 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed. These were 17 increased, 4 decreased, and 14 unevenly expressed protein spots, all of which were analyzed using LTQ-FTICR mass spectrometry. Furthermore, five candidate proteins, up-regulated, were validated by western blotting. These were nucleoredoxin, latexin, aminomethyltransferase, translationally controlled one tumor protein, and rab GDP dissociation inhibitor \u03b2. These observations represent novel findings leading to new insight into the exact mechanism behind the effect of retinoic acids in MCF-7 cells while also identifying possible therapeutic targets for breast cancer diagnosis and novel drug development paths for the treatment of this disease."

        "abstract": "Dynamic actin cytoskeletal reorganization is integral to cell motility. Profilins are well-characterized regulators of actin polymerization; however, functional differences among coexpressed profilin isoforms are not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that profilin-1 and profilin-2 differentially regulate membrane protrusion, motility, and invasion; these processes are promoted by profilin-1 and suppressed by profilin-2. Compared to profilin-1, profilin-2 preferentially drives actin polymerization by the Ena/VASP protein, EVL. Profilin-2 and EVL suppress protrusive activity and cell motility by an actomyosin contractility-dependent mechanism. Importantly, EVL or profilin-2 downregulation enhances invasion in vitro and in vivo. In human breast cancer, lower EVL expression correlates with high invasiveness and poor patient outcome. We propose that profilin-2/EVL-mediated actin polymerization enhances actin bundling and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: One of the major obstacles in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition of prostate cancer growth from androgen dependency to a hormone-refractory state is the lack of androgen-regulated and tumorigenic human prostate cancer cell lines.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have established and characterized a new human prostate cancer cell line, CWR22Pc, derived from the primary CWR22 human prostate xenograft tumors.\\n\\nRESULTS: The growth of CWR22Pc cells is induced markedly by dihydrotestosterone, and CWR22Pc cells express high levels of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Importantly, PSA expression in CWR22Pc cells is regulated by androgens. Stat5a/b, Stat3, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase were constitutively active or cytokine inducible in CWR22Pc cells. The AR in CWR22Pc cells contains the H874Y mutation, but not the exon 3 duplication or other mutations. When inoculated subcutaneously into dihydrotestosterone-supplemented castrated nude mice, large tumors formed rapidly in 20 of 20 mice, whereas no tumors developed in mice without circulating dihydrotestosterone. Moreover, the serum PSA levels correlated with the tumor volumes. When androgens were withdrawn from the CWR22Pc tumors grown in nude mice, the tumors initially shrank but regrew back as androgen-independent tumors.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This androgen-regulated and tumorigenic human prostate cancer cell line provides a valuable tool for studies on androgen regulation of prostate cancer cells and on the molecular mechanisms taking place in growth promotion of prostate cancer when androgens are withdrawn from the growth environment. CWR22Pc cells also provide a model system for studies on the regulation of transcriptional activity of mutated H874YAR in a prostate cancer cell context."

Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is an essential cytokine for osteoclasts, whereas osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble inhibitor for RANKL. We analyzed the regulation of the RANKL/OPG system by estrogens and androgens in the ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. In MCF-7 cells, which predominantly express ER-alpha, 17beta-estradiol and testosterone dose-dependently decreased OPG mRNA levels and protein secretion by 70 and 65%, respectively (p<0.0001 by ANOVA). The inhibition of OPG production by 17beta-estradiol and testosterone was specifically prevented by the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780, and the testosterone effect was prevented by an aromatase inhibitor. In conclusion, 17beta-estradiol suppressed OPG production by human breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent and specific manner, indicating that the RANKL/OPG cytokine system is an estrogen-responsive target in breast cancer."

This study was conducted to define the underlying biochemical mechanism of Cd-induced cell death in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Methods: The MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of CdCl2 and cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. A propidium iodide and annexin-V staining flow cytometric method was used for apoptosis detection. Hoechst 33342 staining was used to observe the morphological changes of cell apoptosis. The cellular DNA was isolated using DNA kit extraction and analyzed electrophoretically. Intracellular ROS levels were quantified using the fluorescent dye (DCFH-DA). Results: A progressive loss in cell viability and an increased number of apoptotic cells were observed upon 48 hours exposure to CdCl2. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration reversed the cadmium cytotoxicity effects and protected cells from apoptotic death. Simultaneously, significant elevations of ROS levels were revealed in a dose-dependent manner during the exposure. Typical morphological changes of apoptosis were observed with Hoechst staining after cadmium treatment. Conclusion: These results suggest that during the apoptosis mediated by cadmium chloride, ROS production and oxidative damage may be an initiating event and responsible for the mechanism of MCF-7 human breast cell death."

        "abstract": "Polyamine analogue treatment results in growth inhibition and sometimes in cell death. Therefore, polyamine analogues are considered in the treatment of cancer; however, the cellular properties that govern sensitivity are not known. The objective of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms behind apoptosis induced by the polyamine analogue N, N-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM). Four different breast cancer cell lines were treated with DENSPM. Cell death was evaluated with flow cytometry and a caspase 3 assay. The levels of a number of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins in subcellular compartments were evaluated with western blot. In the most sensitive cell line, DENSPM treatment induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, resulting in activation of caspase 3 but without decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. However, in the three other cell lines DENSPM treatment did not induce extensive cell death. This is partly explained by the high levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bad and low levels of proapoptotic proteins Bax and procaspase 3 in these three cell lines. The results are also partly explained by the degree of activation of the catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine-N-acetyltransferase and polyamine pool reduction achieved by DENSPM treatment. Our results show that the protein profile of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins may contribute to the outcome to treatment with the polyamine analogue DENSPM. The results also indicate that it should be possible to find molecular markers for sensitivity to DENSPM that could be used in the clinic to predict sensitivity to a polyamine analogue."

The purpose of this study was to design and synthesize functionalized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) targeting survivin gene for the detection of pancreatic cancer. The pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 with survivin gene expression was selected in this study. The healthy lung fibroblast cell was used as a control. Chitosan-coated MNPs (CS@MNPs) and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of survivin gene were conjugated to MNPs to give Sur-MNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed to confirm the conjunction of chitosan. The interactions of MNPs, CS@MNPs, and Sur-MNPs in BxPC-3 cells were observed, recorded and analyzed. The size, morphology, cell uptake, cytotoxicity and stability of those particles were assessed by transmission electron microscope, Prussian blue staining, MTT assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. The magnetic resonance signal intensities of pancreatic cells labeled with CS@MNPs and MNPs, and Sur-MNPs, were compared on T\u2082-weighted images. The results demonstrated that the level of cellular uptake of CS@MNPs was higher than that of naked MNPs. The Sur-MNPs had a suitable size (12 nm sized core), high stability, no cytotoxicity and good water dispersion. Sur-MNPs did not accumulate in healthy lung fibroblast cells, while being taken up by BxPC-3 cells. The Sur-MNPs in BxPC-3 cells could be visualized on T\u2082-weighted images, which suggested that Sur-MNPs could be used to detect the expression of survivin gene. Thus, Sur-MNPs may be a potential molecular imaging probe targeting survivin gene for early detection of pancreatic cancer cells."

Here we investigated the effect of genomic instability, that is loss/gain of chromosomal regions on the global transcriptome of prostate cancer cell line DU145. The genomic loss/gain map obtained through BAC array-based CGH was superimposed on the dynamic transcriptome of DU145 cells treated with serum for 0 h (serum starved), 2 h and 12 h. The genomic analysis suggested that in DU145 cells: (1) chromosomal gains are prominent than losses and (2) copy number changes are associated with chromosome-specific and dynamic gene expression regulatory mechanisms. A significant proportion of the genes in the stable regions of the chromosome were up-regulated whereas a higher proportion of genes were down-regulated at 2 and 12 h in the deleted regions of the chromosomes following serum treatment. No change in expression was observed for the genes in the gained regions over a period of time. This analysis led us to propose that loss of heterozygosity leads to an overall transcriptional down-regulation that may further lead to a decrease in the expression of putative tumor suppressors. The genomic profile of DU145 is similar to pathological specimens of prostate cancer, hence the genomic/transcriptomic signature of DU145 can be used to understand the pathology of prostate cancer. It is expected that this analysis will allow a better understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the context of genomic loss and gain and may lead to the discovery of novel oncogenes and tumor suppressors and the underlying regulatory pathways."

Heterogeneity of tumour cells, however, is particularly critical for therapeutically relevant studies, since it is a prerequisite for acquiring drug resistance and reoccurrence of tumours. Here, we report the isolation of a highly tumourigenic primary pancreatic cancer cell line, called JoPaca-1 and its detailed characterization at multiple levels. Implantation of as few as 100 JoPaca-1 cells into immunodeficient mice gave rise to tumours that were histologically very similar to the primary tumour. The high heterogeneity of JoPaca-1 was reflected by diverse cell morphology and a substantial number of chromosomal aberrations. Comparative whole-genome sequencing of JoPaca-1 and BxPC-3 revealed mutations in genes frequently altered in pancreatic cancer. Exceptionally high expression of cancer stem cell markers and a high clonogenic potential in vitro and in vivo was observed. All of these attributes make this cell line an extremely valuable model to study the biology of and pharmaceutical effects on pancreatic cancer."

Although paclitaxel generally seems to be a powerful agent, it failed to reach a loco-regional tumor control in a sufficient percentage of patients. In order to investigate molecular resistance mechanisms, we have established a paclitaxel-resistant subline originating from the larynx carcinoma cell line HLaC79, which seemed to be partially dependent on taxol. The original and the descendant cell line were characterized by growth inhibition assays. We used western blotting and the cDNA subtraction (SSH) technique to identify genes differentially expressed in the taxol-resistant cell clone. cDNA subtraction revealed increased expression of six genes, including clathrin heavy chain, alpha3-tubulin, a neuroblastoma-specific Thymosin beta, the ribosomal protein L7a, HLA-B associated transcript 3 and collagen IIIalpha1 in the taxol-resistant cell line. Furthermore, western blots showed an overexpression of MDR-1 in the taxol-resistant clone, while alpha- and beta-tubulins and p48/IRF9 were expressed in equal amounts in both cell lines."

        "abstract": "Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), considered one of the most important TLR, recognizes lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. Recognition of ligands by TLRs induces signaling pathways resulting in activation of transcriptional factors such as NF-\u03baB which are involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To prevent an inappropriate immune response, a complex network of molecules negatively regulates TLRs and their associated signaling pathways. Two cosegregating single nucleotide polymorphisms of the human TLR4 gene, namely Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, have been associated with hyporesponsiveness to inhaled LPS. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of TLR4 gene variant on NF-\u03baB activity in colorectal cancer cell line. HCT116 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutants Flag-CMV1-TLR4 expression vectors. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate selected molecules involved in TLR4 signaling. NF-\u03baB activity was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and cytokine profiles were evaluated byELISA and Cytometric Bead Array method. Results showed that the activity of pNF-\u03baB was higher in cells harboring TLR4 D299G compared to the other cells. However, the activity of pAKT, pERK1 and pIRAK was higher in wild-type. The results of cytokine measurements showed about four fold higher level of IL-8 in cells with wild-type TLR4. This study suggest that TLR4 Asp299Gly gene variant has an impact on TLR4 signaling and potentially on intestinal homeostasis due to impaired control signals at the epithelial cell level which may lead to chronic intestinal in\ufb02ammation and interrupted intestinal homeostasis and may eventually lead to colorectal cancer."

        "abstract": "The mechanism by which raloxifene acts in the chemoprevention of breast cancer remains unclear. Because telomerase activity is involved in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of raloxifene on estrogen-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Raloxifene inhibited the induction of cell growth and telomerase activity by 17beta-estradiol (E2). Raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced expression of the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT), and transient expression assays using luciferase reporter plasmids containing various fragments of the hTERT promoter showed that the estrogen-responsive element appeared to be partially responsible for the action of raloxifene. E2 induced the phosphorylation of Akt, and pretreatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, attenuated the E2-induced increases of the telomerase activity and hTERT promoter activity. Raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced Akt phosphorylation. In addition, raloxifene also inhibited the E2-induced hTERT expression via the PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB cascade. Moreover, raloxifene also inhibited the E2-induced phosphorylation of hTERT, association of NFkappaB with hTERT, and nuclear accumulation of hTERT. These results show that raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity not only by transcriptional regulation of hTERT via an estrogen-responsive element-dependent mechanism and the PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB cascade but also by post-translational regulation via phosphorylation of hTERT and association with NFkappaB."

Although HB-EGF is widely expressed in tumors when compared to normal tissue, its contribution to tumor invasion is still not known. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of HB-EGF on the invasion activity of a cultured oral cancer cell line using short interfering RNA (siRNA). Oral squamous carcinoma cell lines, HSC3 and SAS, were transfected with siRNA targeting HBEGF. Expression of HB-EGF was analyzed by real-time PCR. The invasiveness of the transfected cells was determined using a matrigel invasion assay, and MMP-9 production was measured by RTPCR and gelatin zymography. The expression of HB-EGF was reduced in HSC3-siRNA and SAS-siRNA cells. The matrigel invasion assay demonstrated that the invasiveness of HSC3-siRNA and SAS-siRNA cells was reduced. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that in HSC3-siRNA and SAS-siRNA cells, MMP9 production was decreased. These findings suggest that HB-EGF expression is related to the invasion activity of oral cancer, particularly via regulation of MMP9."

In so doing, we identified F16, a small molecule that selectively inhibits proliferation of mammary epithelial, neu-overexpressing cells, as well as a variety of mouse mammary tumor and human breast cancer cell lines. F16 belongs to a group of structurally similar molecules with a delocalized positive charge. The compound is accumulated in mitochondria of responsive cells, driven by the membrane potential, and it compromises their functional integrity. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization is a shared feature of many tumor cell lines, explaining the broad action spectrum of this novel delocalized lipophilic cation."

        "abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancer. Several mechanisms have been identified in resistance to doxorubicin by analysis of resistant urothelial carcinoma (UC) cell lines, prominently activation of drug efflux pumps and diminished apoptosis. We have derived a new doxorubicin-resistant cell line from BFTC-905 UC cells, designated BFTC-905-DOXO-II. A doxorubicin-responsive green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay indicated that resistance in BFTC-905-DOXO-II was not due to increased drug efflux pump activity, whereas caspase-3/7 activation was indeed diminished. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed changes in proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes, but additionally induction of the mevalonate (cholesterol) biosynthetic pathway. Treatment with simvastatin restored sensitivity of BFTC-905-DOXO-II to doxorubicin to that of the parental cell line. Induction of the mevalonate pathway has been reported as a mechanism of chemoresistance in other cancers; this is the first observation in bladder cancer. Combinations of statins with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimens may provide a therapeutic advantage in such cases."

This study attempts to validate the stochastic model, relating absorbed dose to the emission and processing of cell death signals by non-irradiated cells, in vitro in PC3 human prostate cancer cell line.\\n\\nMETHODS: The recipient cell survival was measured after exposure of cells to ICMM derived from donor cells: a) exposed to radiation doses from 2 Gy to 8 Gy and b) of concentrations varying from 2 \u00d7 10(2) to 6 \u00d7 10(6) irradiated with 2 Gy.\\n\\nRESULTS: Exposure to ICCM, irradiated with doses between 2-8 Gy, resulted in a significant (p <\u20090.001) decrease in clonogenic survival of non-irradiated recipient cells compared to the control group. However, dose dependency above 2 Gy was not observed, indicating that any dose threshold was below 2 Gy. A significant (p <\u20090.001) decrease in survival was found in recipient cells exposed to the ICCM, derived from different concentrations of donor cells exposed to 2 Gy, compared to the control group. The recipient cell survival following exposure to ICCM derived from 2 \u00d7 10(2) cells was significantly higher (p <\u20090.5) compared to the rest of donor cell concentrations, indicating that the toxicity of ICCM depends on the cellular concentration of donor cells. Non-linear regression data fitting provided reasonable agreement with the microdosimetric model for the induction of cell killing through medium-borne signals.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: For the given cell line and given experimental conditions, significant decreases in cell survival were observed in non-irradiated cells exposed to ICCM derived from donor cells of various concentrations and irradiated with different doses."

        "abstract": "Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been associated with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Irinotecan (CPT-11), a DNA topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, has been recently incorporated to the adjuvant therapy. Since the DNA-damage checkpoint depends on p53 activation, the status of p53 might critically influence the response to CPT-11. We analysed the sensitivity to CPT-11 in the human colon cancer cell line HT29 (mut p53) and its wild-type (wt)-p53 stably transfected subclone HT29-A4. Cell-cycle analysis in synchronised cells demonstrated the activation of transfected wt-p53 and a p21(WAF1/CIP1)-dependent cell-cycle blockage in the S phase. Activated wt-p53 increased apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to CPT-11. In p53-deficient cells, cDNA-macroarray analysis and western blotting showed an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1/cyclin B complex. Subsequent p53-independent activation of the cdk-inhibitor (cdk-I) p21(WAF1/CIP1) prevented cell-cycle progression. Cdk1 induction was exploited in vivo to improve the sensitivity to CPT-11 by additional treatment with the cdk-I CYC-202. We demonstrate a gain of sensitivity to CPT-11 in a p53-mutated colon cancer model either by restoring wild-type p53 function or by sequential treatment with cdk-Is. Considering that mutations in p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC, a therapeutic approach specifically targeting p53-deficient tumors could greatly improve the treatment outcomes."

The cytotoxic effect of the 50% ethanolic and aqueous extract, determined by the MTT and NR assays, was evaluated in vitro on Human Colon Cancer Cell Line (HCT-116), using Triton 10% as positive control. The 50% ethanolic extract showed significant differences after 72 h of treatment, reducing cell proliferation to values close to 40%, even the lowest dose tested (5 mu g/ml). In the MTT assay, the same extract caused the lowest cell viability with 13% at a concentration of 1,000 mu g/ml after 72 h of treatment, being a value lower than Triton 10%. The antioxidant activity was also confirmed evaluating the capacity of the extracts to scavenge ABTS and DPPH radicals, and IC(50) values were highly correlated with the total phenolic and flavonoid content. Bioassay guided fractionation led to the isolation of an anti-proliferative compound, rosmarinic acid. Its structural elucidation was performed by HPLC/DAD/ESI/MS analysis. High dose of rosmarinic acid (1,000 mu g/ml) was clearly cytotoxic against HCT-116 cells, with a significant decrease in cell number since the earliest time point (24 h)."

The brominated phenols, however, although binding to the ER, did not stimulate cell growth or increase the levels of the PgR or pS2, or reduce the level of 17\u03b2-E induced pS2. On the contrary, 4-BP, 2,4-DBP and partly 4-tert-BP reduced 17\u03b2-E-stimulated cell growth apparently by an ER independent mechanism. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "The p53 gene suppresses tumor cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Loss of its apoptosis activity has been implicated not only in tumor development but also in chemoresistance. We previously reported that targeting p53 for degradation by the human HPV E6 gene in the ovarian cancer cell line PA1 leads to an increase in the chemoresistant phenotype. Here we investigate the relationship between loss of p53-dependent caspase activation and chemosensitivity. In PA1-neo cells with wild-type p53, the activation of caspases including caspases 9, 8, 7 and 3 and cleavage of PARP were detected following adriamycin or etoposide treatment, whereas no such changes were observed in PA1-E6 cells whose p53 is degraded, suggesting that loss of p53 impairs caspase activation. Importantly, we showed that loss of caspase activation in PA1-E6 cells correlates with increased cell survival. Moreover, PA1 cells overexpressing a dominant negative caspase 9 were found to have decreased caspase-dependent apoptosis, as compared with vector control cells. Furthermore, these dominant negative caspase 9 expressing cells were resistant to chemotherapeutic agent-induced killing. Our results suggest that caspase 9 may be an important target for anticancer drug development. Thus, identifying novel compounds that can activate caspase 9 may be a strategy for overcoming a defect in the p53 apoptosis pathway."

METHODS: We constructed recombinant adenovirus vector expressing a mutant type p27(kip1) gene (ad-p27mt), with mutation of Thr-187/Pro-188 (ACGCCC) to Met-187/Ile-188 (ATGATC), and transduced into SW480 cells. Then we detected expression of p27, Bcl-2 and Bax protein in the transductants by Western blotting, cell cycle of transductants by a digital flow cytometric system, migrating potential with Boyden Chamber and SW480 tumor cell growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We found that a recombinant adenovirus vector of expressing ad-p27mt, with mutation of Thr-187/Pro-188 (ACGCCC) to Met-187/Ile-188 (ATGATC) has potent inhibition of SW480 tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ad-p27mt induced cell apoptosis via regulating bax and bcl-2 expressions, and G(1)/S arrest in SW480 cells and inhibited cell migration. CONCLUSION: ad-p27mt has a strong anti-tumor bioactivity and has the potential to develop into new therapeutic agents for colorectal cancer."

        "abstract": "Gelsolin expression is frequently downregulated in lung cancer and several types of different human cancers. To examine the effects of gelsolin restoration on tumorigenicity, we here stably expressed various levels of gelsolin via gene transfer in lung cancer cells (squamous cell carcinoma line, PC10). We observed the alterations in tumorigenicity in vivo when implanted in nude mice, and the changes in growth properties in vitro. As compared to parental cells and control clones, gelsolin transfectants highly reduced tumorigenicity and repressed cell proliferation. Moreover, we investigated bradykinin-induced responses in gelsolin-overexpressing clones, because agonist-stimulated activation of the phospholipases C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathway is critical for cell growth and tumorigenicity. Bradykinin promotes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis by PLC and translocation of various PKC isoforms from the cytosolic fraction to the particulate fraction. Bradykinin treatment did not increase inositoltriphosphate (IP3) production and induce the membrane fractions of PKC alpha and PKC gamma in gelsolin tranfectants, while it induced PIP2 hydrolysis and increased the fractions in parental and control clones. These results suggest that gelsolin suppressed the activation of PKCs involved in phospholipid signalling pathways, inhibiting cell proliferation and tumorigenicity."

Several of these genes encode pharmacologically tractable proteins, such as Syk and Ron kinases and integrin \u03b26, depletion of which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and apoptosis specifically in K-Ras-dependent cells.

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer is one of the most important diseases associated with arsenic (As) exposure in view of its high prevalence and mortality rate. Experimental studies have shown that As exposure induces cell proliferation in the bladder of sodium arsenite (iAsIII) subchronically treated mice. However, there is little available information on its effects on the cell cycle of bladder cells. Thus, our purpose was to evaluate the effects of iAsIII on cell cycle progression and the response of p53 and p21 on the human-derived epithelial bladder cell line HT1197. iAsIII treatment (1-10 microM) for 24 h induced a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of cells in S-phase, which reached 65% at the highest dose. A progressive reduction in cell proliferation was also observed. BrdU was incorporated to cellular DNA in an interrupted form, suggesting an incomplete DNA synthesis. The time-course of iAsIII effects (10 microM) showed an increase in p53 protein content and a transient increase in p21 protein levels accompanying the changes in S-phase. These effects were correlated with iAs concentrations inside the cells, which were not able to metabolize inorganic arsenic. Our findings suggest that p21 was not able to block CDK2-cyclin E complex activity and was therefore unable to arrest cells in G1 allowing their progression into the S-phase. Further studies are needed to ascertain the mechanisms underlying the effects of iAsIII on the G1 to S phase transition in bladder cells."

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of male death in Western countries. Prostate cancer mortality results from metastases to the bones and lymph nodes and progression from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent disease. Although androgen ablation was found to be effective in treating androgen-dependent prostate cancer, no effective life-prolonging therapy is available for androgen-independent cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and a lower risk of prostate cancer. These vegetables contain glucosinolates, which during metabolism give rise to several breakdown products, mainly indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which may be condensed to polymeric products, especially 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM). It was previously shown that these indole derivatives have significant inhibitory effects in several human cancer cell lines, which are exerted through induction of apoptosis. We have previously reported that I3C and DIM induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines through p53-, bax-, bcl-2- and fasL-independent pathways. The objective of this study was examination of the apoptotic pathways that may be involved in the effect of DIM in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, PC3, in vitro. Our results suggest that DIM induces apoptosis in PC3 cells, through the mitochondrial pathway, which involves the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the activation of initiator caspase, 9, and effector caspases, 3 and 6, leading to poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and induction of apoptosis. Our findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer."

Our studies revealed that the ErbB3-neuregulin 1 (NRG1) axis is a dominant pathway responsible for hematogenous omental metastasis. Elevated levels of ErbB3 in ovarian cancer cells and NRG1 in the omentum allowed for tumor cell localization and growth in the omentum. Depletion of ErbB3 in ovarian cancer impaired omental metastasis. Our results highlight hematogenous metastasis as an important mode of ovarian cancer metastasis.

In solid tumors, hypoxia is strongly associated with malignant progression and resistance to therapy, which is an indicator of poor prognosis. The antiproliferative effect and induced death caused by doxorubicin, epirubicin, cisplatin, and flutamide in a hormone-independent PCa cell line will be evaluated. The hypoxia effect on drug resistance to these drugs, as well as cell proliferation and migration, will be also analyzed. All drugs induced an antiproliferative effect and also cell death in the cell line under study. Hypoxia made the cells more resistant to all drugs. Moreover, our results reveal that long time cell exposure to hypoxia decreases cellular proliferation and migration. Hypoxia can influence cellular resistance, proliferation, and migration. This study shows that hypoxia may be a key factor in the regulation of PCa."

        "abstract": "We present here a new cell line, NOR-P1, established from a metastatic subcutaneous tumor of a patient with pancreatic cancer. The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 16 h and high migration activity. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity and a mutation in the K-ras oncogene. Of particular interest, the cells express markedly elevated mRNA levels of angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, as well as other tumor growth-related factors. Subcutaneous transplantation of the NOR-P1 cells into nude mice formed solid, hemorrhagic tumors which were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma with dense blood vessels and severe extravasation of blood. Furthermore, when NOR-P1 cell suspension was injected directly into the pancreas of nude mice, the cells grew rapidly to form intra-pancreatic tumors associated with liver metastases and peritoneal dissemination that resulted in cachexia and subsequent death. These properties suggest that NOR-P1 is an aggressive pancreatic cancer cell line with a high metastatic potential and may serve as a useful experimental model for studying tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer."

Both leaf and seed extracts significantly inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner, although leaf extract was more effective.

Loquat extract also inhibited the invasion of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and leaf extract was more effective than seed extract. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were also inhibited by loquat extract. Our results indicate that methanol extracts of loquat inhibit the adhesion, migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells partially through the inhibition of MMP activity and leaf extract has more anti-metastatic effects in cell based assay than seed extract.

        "abstract": "The incidence of thyroid cancer increases with age, and it is twice in women as common as in men. The undifferentiated thyroid cancer (UTC) is the most aggressive of all thyroid cancers. Unfortunately, there are almost no efficacious therapeutic modalities. It is important to develop some new effective therapies. Evodiamine is a chemical extracted from a kind of Chinese herb named Wu-Chu-Yu and has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing the growth of a variety of cancer cells. In the present study, the mechanism by which evodiamine inhibited the undifferentiated thyroid cancer cell line ARO was examined. Based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol -2-yle)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell proliferation rate was reduced dose-dependently by evodiamine, but not by rutaecarpine. According to the flow cytometric analysis, evodiamine treatment resulted in G2/M arrest and DNA fragmentation in ARO cells. The G2/M arrest was accompanied with an increase of the expression of cdc25C, cyclin B1, and cdc2-p161 protein, and it was also with a decrease of the expression of cdc2-p15. Furthermore, by using the TUNEL assay, evodiamine-induced apoptosis was observed at 48 h and extended to 72 h. Western blotting demonstrated that evodiamine treatment induced the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). These results suggested that evodiamine inhibited the growth of the ARO cells, arrested them at M phase, and induced apoptosis through caspases signaling."

The CD90+ cells, but not the CD90(-) cells, from HCC cell lines displayed tumorigenic capacity. All the tumor specimens and 91.6% of blood samples from liver cancer patients bore the CD45(-)CD90+ population, which could generate tumor nodules in immunodeficient mice. The CD90+CD44+ cells demonstrated a more aggressive phenotype than the CD90+CD44(-) counterpart and formed metastatic lesions in the lung of immunodeficient mice. CD44 blockade prevented the formation of local and metastatic tumor nodules by the CD90+ cells. Differential gene expression profiles were identified in the CD45(-)CD90+ and CD45(-)CD90(-) cells isolated from tissue and blood samples from liver cancer patients and controls."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in women worldwide both in the developed and developing countries. Thus effective treatment of breast cancer with potential antitumour drugs is important. In this paper, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 has been employed to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of red sorghum bran anthocyanin. The present investigation showed that red sorghum bran anthocyanin induced growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells at significant level. The growth inhibition is dose dependent and irreversible in nature. When MCF-7 cells were treated with red sorghum bran anthocyanins due to activity of anthocyanin morphological changes were observed. The morphological changes were identified through the formation of apoptopic bodies. The fragmentation by these anthocyanins on DNA to oligonuleosomal-sized fragments, is a characteristic of apoptosis, and it was observed as concentration-dependent. Thus, this paper clearly demonstrates that human breast cancer cell MCF-7 is highly responsive by red sorghum bran anthocyanins result from the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells."

        "abstract": "Breast cancers commonly cause osteolytic metastases in bone, a process that is dependent upon osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, but the mechanism responsible for tumor-mediated osteoclast activation has not yet been clarified. In the present study we utilized a well-known human breast cancer cell line (MDA-231) in order to assess its capability to influence osteoclastogenesis in human bone marrow cultures and bone resorption in fully differentiated osteoclasts. We demonstrated that conditioned medium (CM) harvested from MDA-231 increased the formation of multinucleated TRAP-positive cells in bone marrow cultures. Bone resorption activity of fully differentiated human osteoclasts and of osteoclast-like cell lines, from giant cell tumors of bone (GCT), was highly increased by the presence of MDA-231 CM. Moreover, while MDA-231 by themselves did not produce IL-6 tumor cell, CM increased the secretion of IL-6 by primary human osteoclasts and GCT cell lines compared to untreated controls. These data suggest that MDA-231 produce osteoclastic activating factor(s) that increase both osteoclast formation in bone marrow culture and bone resorption activity by mature cells. Moreover, breast cancer cells stimulate IL-6 secretion by osteoclasts that is one of the factors known to supports osteoclastogenesis."

In order to apply this potential to anti-cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT), we prepared a novel variant of 6FP, 2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyleneamino)-6-formyl-3-pivaloylpteridine-4-one (6FP-tBu-DMF), and examined its photodynamic effects on a pancreatic cancer cell line, Panc-1 cells. The study using laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that the drug uptake, the 1O2 generation, and cell death were observed in the 6FP-tBu-DMF-treated cells, while these phenomena were not observed in the 6FP-treated cells. The MTT assay also showed the decrease in cell viability only in the 6FP-tBu-DMF-treated cells. Since 6FP and 6FP-tBu-DMF generate 1O2 to the same extent under UV-A radiation in aqueous solutions, these results indicated that the differences in the photodynamic effects between 6FP and 6FP-tBu-DMF were entirely attributed to the differences in the cell permeability between them.

Recent studies revealed that survivin correlated with the chemo-resitance of cancer cells. In the present study, the changes in expression levels of survivin messenger RNA (mRNA) and survivin protein in a gastric cancer cell line (MKN-45) during cisplatin (CDDP) treatment were analyzed and compared with the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Cell growth was inhibited even with a low dose CDDP (0.1 or 1 microg/ml) 1 hr treatment. However, the percentage of apoptotic cells did not change after 48 hr incubation with low dose CDDP. Only with high dose CDDP (10 microg/ml), did the percentage of apoptotic cells explosively increase between 12 and 24 hr treatment. Relative expression levels of survivin mRNA and survivin protein increased after CDDP treatment. The cell expression rates of survivin mRNA after 48 hr treatment with 0.1 and 1 microg/ml of CDDP were 2 to 6 fold higher than that of the survivin mRNA of untreated cells. Also, the relative cell expression level of survivin protein after 24 hr treatment with 0.1 or 1 microg/ml of CDDP was 3 to 6.5 fold higher than that of the survivin protein of untreated cells. These results indicate that survivin expression may correlate with the chemo-resistance of malignant cells."

SUMMARY A variety of cancers depend on JAK2 signaling, including the high-risk subset of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) with CRLF2 rearrangements. Type I JAK2 inhibitors induce paradoxical JAK2 hyperphos-phorylation in these leukemias and have limited activity. To improve the efficacy of JAK2 inhibition in B-ALL, we developed the type II inhibitor CHZ868, which stabilizes JAK2 in an inactive conformation. CHZ868 potently suppressed the growth of CRLF2-rearranged human B-ALL cells, abrogated JAK2 signaling, and improved survival in mice with human or murine B-ALL. CHZ868 and dexamethasone synergistically induced apoptosis in JAK2-dependent B-ALLs and further improved in vivo survival compared to CHZ868 alone. These data support the testing of type II JAK2 inhibition in patients with JAK2-dependent leukemias and other disorders."

        "abstract": "We find that the prostate cancer cell lines ALVA-31, PC-3, and DU 145 are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by TRAIL (tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), while the cell lines TSU-Pr1 and JCA-1 are moderately sensitive, and the LNCaP cell line is resistant. LNCaP cells lack active lipid phosphatase PTEN, a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt pathway, and demonstrate a high constitutive Akt activity. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase using wortmannin and LY-294002 suppressed constitutive Akt activity and sensitized LNCaP cells to TRAIL. Treatment of LNCaP cells with TRAIL alone induced cleavage of the caspase 8 and XIAP proteins. However, processing of BID, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases 7 and 9, and apoptosis did not occur unless TRAIL was combined with either wortmannin, LY-294002, or cycloheximide. Blocking cytochrome c release by Bcl-2 overexpression rendered LNCaP cells resistant to TRAIL plus wortmannin treatment but did not affect caspase 8 or BID processing. This indicates that in these cells mitochondria are required for the propagation rather than the initiation of the apoptotic cascade. Infection of LNCaP cells with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active Akt reversed the ability of wortmannin to potentiate TRAIL-induced BID cleavage. Thus, the PI 3-kinase-dependent blockage of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells appears to be mediated by Akt through the inhibition of BID cleavage."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing-by-synthesis is an emerging technology that allows the rapid production of millions of bases of data. Although the sequence reads are short, they can readily be used for re-sequencing. By re-sequencing the mRNA products of a cell, one may rapidly discover polymorphisms and splice variants particular to that cell. RESULTS: We present the utility of massively parallel sequencing by synthesis for profiling the transcriptome of a human prostate cancer cell-line, LNCaP, that has been treated with the synthetic androgen, R1881. Through the generation of approximately 20 megabases (MB) of EST data, we detect transcription from over 10,000 gene loci, 25 previously undescribed alternative splicing events involving known exons, and over 1,500 high quality single nucleotide discrepancies with the reference human sequence. Further, we map nearly 10,000 ESTs to positions on the genome where no transcription is currently predicted to occur. We also characterize various obstacles with using sequencing by synthesis for transcriptome analysis and propose solutions to these problems. CONCLUSION: The use of high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis methods for transcript profiling allows the specific and sensitive detection of many of a cell's transcripts, and also allows the discovery of high quality base discrepancies, and alternative splice variants. Thus, this technology may provide an effective means of understanding various disease states, discovering novel targets for disease treatment, and discovery of novel transcripts."

        "abstract": "Intratumor genetic heterogeneity, a well-known characteristic of numerous cancers, often confounds a precise diagnosis and leads to therapy resistance. This study deals with such chromosomal variability, which may be due to an inherent genetic instability affecting heterogeneity and clonal effects. Subpopulations of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 were isolated according to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by FACS. Whole genome profiling (CGH; mapping arrays) and determination of egfr gene amplification (fluorescence in situ hybridisation, FISH; qPCR) were done directly after sorting or after several passages of cell culture. Subpopulations differed in the amplification of the egfr-locus 7p11-14 showing egfr gene amplification rates of up to 60-fold in high-level expressing populations and less than 2-fold in low-level expressing populations. However, after several passages the original low-level cells showed a new amplification of the egfr gene, which was as heterogeneous as the original amplification detected in MDA-MB-468. Additional, spontaneously expressed fragile sites could be shown in FISH analyses which may affect cell culture heterogeneity. Understanding the precise chromosomal process would clarify mechanisms in vivo and improve both diagnosis and therapy of corresponding cancers."

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of quercetin (QC) in the human lung cancer cell line A-549 and further study the mechanism of apoptosis induction by QC. Low differentiation potential A-549 human lung cancer cells were treated with QC at different doses and for different times, and the growth inhibitory rates were detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis induced by QC in A-549 cells was observed by Annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometric assay. The relative tumor growth ratio of the treated/control tumors (T/C) (%) was chosen to represent the tumor growth inhibition of A-549 cell nude mouse xenografts by QC. Apoptosis of the nude mouse xenografts was observed by Annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometric assay and DNA fragmentation assay. To further determine the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by QC, changes in the expression of bcl-2 and bax genes were detected by RT-PCR. Following incubation with QC, the cell growth of the low differentiation potential A-549 human lung cancer cells was dramatically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. After the cells were exposed to QC for 24, 48 and 72 h, the IC50 value was 1.02 \u00b1 0.05, 1.41 \u00b1 0.20 and 1.14 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b5mol/l, respectively. Apoptosis in the A-549 cells induced by QC was noted. The apoptotic subpopulation of A-549 cells was approximately 12.96 and 24.58%, respectively, when cells were incubated with 1.2 \u00b5mol/l QC for 48 and 72 h. T/C (%) of A-549 nude mouse xenografts was 44.3, when the nude mice were treated with QC (8 mg/kg). Meanwhile, apoptosis induced by QC was observed in the A-549 nude mouse xenografts. Increased expression of the bax gene and decreased expression of the bc1-2 gene were noted using RT-PCR. Our results provide further evidence of the growth inhibition of the A-549 human lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line by QC. This effect is associated with the induction of apoptosis in A-549 cells and the molecular mechanism may be related to the reduction in expression of the apoptosis-regulating gene bcl-2, and increase in expression of the apoptosis-regulating gene bax. These results were also confirmed in vivo."

To address whether SP cells exist in epidermal squamous cancer cell line A431, A431 cells dyed with Hoechst 33342 were sorted through flow cytometry. The SP cells were then analyzed by colony-forming and cell proliferation assay. Further, tumorigenicity and microarray analysis were used to compare biological difference between SP and non-SP (NSP) cells. Our results showed that SP cells existed in the A431 cell line, showing higher proliferating and colony-forming ability than NSP cells. Tumors generated from SP cells were larger than those from the NSP cells in NOD/SCID mice. The mRNA microarray profiling revealed that five cancer marker gene expressions were up-regulated and one tumor suppressor gene expression was down-regulated. These findings suggest that SP cells in A431 could contribute to self-renewal, neoplastic transformation, and cancer metastasis of human epidermal squamous cell carcinoma."

Using the last release of the UMD_p53 database (2007) (http://p53.free.fr), we analysed the p53 status of 1,211 cell lines published between 1989 and 2007. p53 mutations in cell lines from various types of cancers display a striking similarity in the distribution of mutations and in the pattern of mutational events compared to tumors, indicating that they are representative of the cells from which they were derived. Analysis of the residual transcriptional activity of p53 mutants identified in cell lines that displayed two different p53 mutations show that there is a high frequency of weak mutations that are paired with more potent mutations suggesting a driver/passenger configuration. Strikingly, we found discrepancies in the p53 status for 23% (88/384) of cell lines, for which the p53 status was established independently in two laboratories. Using the NCI-60 cell line panel as a model widely used in the literature, the p53 status could not be ascertained for 13 cell lines due to a lack of homogeneous data in the literature. Our study clearly confirms that misidentified cell lines are still a silent and neglected danger and that extreme care should be taken as a wrong p53 status could lead to disastrous experimental interpretations. The p53 web site has been updated with new sections describing the p53 status in the majority of cell lines and a special section devoted to cell lines with controversial p53 status."

We demonstrate that CAFs also mediate tumor-enhancing inflammation. Using a mouse model of squamous skin carcinogenesis, we found a proinflammatory gene signature in CAFs isolated from dysplastic skin. This signature was maintained in CAFs from subsequent skin carcinomas and was evident in mammary and pancreatic tumors in mice and in cognate human cancers. The inflammatory signature was already activated in CAFs isolated from the initial hyperplastic stage in multistep skin tumorigenesis. CAFs from this pathway promoted macrophage recruitment, neovascularization, and tumor growth, activities that are abolished when NF-??B signaling was inhibited. Additionally, we show that normal dermal fibroblasts can be \"educated\" by carcinoma cells to express proinflammatory genes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "In order to elucidate the mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR) of vincristine-resistant human gastric carcinoma cell line SGC7901/VCR, 2-DE was used to separate the total proteins of SGC7901/VCR and its parental cell line SGC7901. PDQuest software was applied to analyze 2-DE images, and the differential protein spots were identified by both MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-Q-TOF-MS. Then the differential expressional levels of partially identified proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, the association of heat shock protein (HSP27), one of the highly expressed proteins in sgc7901/vcr, with MDR was analyzed using antisense inhibition of HSP27. In this study, the well-resolved, reproducible 2-DE patterns of SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901 were established, and yielded about 1100 protein-spots each. All the 24 differential proteins between the two cell lines were identified, and the differential expression levels of the partial proteins were confirmed. The suppression of HSP27 expression by HSP27 antisense oligonucleotides could enhance vincristine chemosensitivity in sgc7901/vcr and induce the cells to exhibit apoptotic morphological features after vincristine treatment. The differentially expressed proteins could be divided into six groups based on their functions: calcium-binding proteins, chaperones, proteins involved in drug detoxification or repair of DNA damage, metabolic enzymes, proteins related to cellular structure, and proteins relative to signal transduction, some of which may contribute to MDR of human gastric carcinoma cell line SGC7901/VCR. These data will be valuable for further study of the mechanisms of MDR in human gastric cancer."

        "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpes virus. EBV gene transcription is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism to establish a persistent infection and to evade the host immune system. We found that low concentrations of epigenetic modifying agents, 5-aza-2???-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) or trichostatin A (TSA), induced the expression of BMRF1, BZLF1, and BRLF1 genes, which are found in the lytic form of the virus, in an EBV-positive gastric cancer cell line. This effect did not involve PI3 kinase, MAP/ERK kinase, protein kinase C ??, or p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The cytotoxic effect of ganciclovir (GCV) was enhanced after the lytic induction by epigenetic modifiers, and the combination of GCV and epigenetic modifiers induced apoptosis, which is dependent on caspases. In conclusion, the combination of GCV with 5-aza-CdR or TSA might be a useful therapeutic strategy for EBV-induced human gastric cancer. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many plant-derived products exhibit potent chemopreventive activity against animal tumor models as well as rodent and human cancer cell lines. They have low side effects and toxicity and presumably modulate the factors that are critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. The present study investigates the effects of some medicinal plant extracts from generally recognized as safe plants that may be useful in the prevention and treatment of cancer. METHODS: Clonogenic assays using logarithmically-growing cells were performed to test the effect. The cytotoxic effects of Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale were studied using sulforhodamine B assay, tetrazolium dye assay, colony morphology and microscopic analysis. RESULTS: Out of the 13 lyophilized plant-derived extracts evaluated for growth-inhibitory effects on the PC-3M prostate cancer cell line, two extracts derived from C. longa and Z. officinale showed significant inhibitory effects on colony-forming ability. The individual and augmentative effects of these two extracts were tested for their narrow range effective lower concentration on PC-3M in clonogenic assays. At relatively lower concentrations, C. longa showed significant inhibition of colony formation in clonogenic assays; whereas at same concentrations Z. officinale showed only moderate inhibitory effects. However, when both the agents were tested together at the same concentrations, the combined effects were much more significant than their individual ones. On normal prostate epithelial cells both C. longa and Z. officinale had similar effects but at a lower magnitude. These observations were confirmed by several cytotoxicity assays involving the morphological appearance of the colonies, microscopic observations, per cent inhibition in comparison to control by sulforhodamine B and tetrazolium dye assay. CONCLUSIONS: From these observations, it was concluded that the combined effects of C. longa and Z. officinale are much greater than their individual effects, suggesting the role of multiple components and their synergistic mode of actions to elicit stronger beneficial effects."

METHODS: Recombinant plasmids carrying antisense Bmi-1 RNA were transfected into A549 cells, which expressed a high level of endogenous Bmi-1. The mRNA level of A549 cell was analyzed by real time quantitative RT-PCR and the protein level was determined using Western blot. MTT growth curve and plate colony forming assay were used to measure the effect of antisense Bmi-1 RNA expression on the growth of A549. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle and apoptosis. RESULTS: Antisense Bmi-1 RNA reduced the Bmi-1 expression at the protein level, but did not alter the mRNA level in A549 cells. Compared with the control cells, A549 cells transfected with antisense Bmi-1 RNA showed a strong inhibition of the cell growth. The number of plate colony formation of the antisense Bmi-1 transfected cells (0.67 +/- 0.50) was less than those of the control (73.0 +/- 4.1) and cells transfected with empty vector (67.0 +/- 4.0, P < 0.01). Transfection of antisense Bmi-1 RNA arrested the A549 cells at G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and did not increase the apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Antisense Bmi-1 RNA expression inhibits A549 cells proliferation, likely through the interference of Bmi-1 leading to an arrest of the proliferating cells at the G(0)/G(1) phase."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be a source of tumor recurrence due to their stem cell-like properties. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate both normal stem cells and CSCs, and dysregulation of miRNAs has an important role in tumorigenesis. Cluster of differentiation (CD) 133+and spheroid formation have been reported to be one of the main features of ovarian CSCs. Therefore, we determined the miRNA expression profile of a CD133+spheroid-forming subpopulation of the OVCAR3 human ovarian cancer cell line. METHODS: Initially, we confirmed the enrichment of the OVCAR3 CD133 subpopulation by evaluating in vitro anchorage-independent growth. After obtaining a subpopulation of CD133+OVCAR3 cells with > 98% purity via cell sorting, miRNA microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to evaluate its miRNA profile. RESULTS: We found 37 differentially expressed miRNAs in the CD133+spheroid-forming subpopulation of OVCAR3 cells, 34 of which were significantly up-regulated, including miR-205, miR-146a, miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-3, and 3 of which were significantly downregulated, including miR-1202 and miR-1181. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that dysregulation of miRNA may play a role in the stem cell-like properties of ovarian CSCs."

This SNU-719 cell line from a Korean patient expressed cytokeratin without CD19 or CD21 expression. In SNU-719, EBNA1 and LMP2A were expressed, while LMP1 and EBNA2 were not. None of the tested lytic EBV proteins were detected in this cell line unless stimulated with phorbol ester. EBV infection was also shown in the original carcinoma tissue of SNU-719 cell line. Our results support the possibility of a CD21-independent EBV infection of gastric epithelial cells in vivo. As the latent EBV gene expression pattern of SNU-719 closely resembles that of the EBV-associated gastric cancer, this naturally derived cell line may serve as a valuable model system to clarify the precise role of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells eliminate virus-infected and tumor cells through the release of perforins and granzymes; they also produce Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which induce apoptosis in target cells. Many tumors express Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and this expression has been associated with avoiding immunosuppression and apoptosis. In this work, HO-1+ Cervical cancer cell (CCC) lines were pre-treated with HO-1 inhibitor and we assessed whether this inhibition enhanced the sensitivity of CCC to NK cell activity.\\n\\nMETHODS: We assessed the expression of HO-1 in HeLa, SiHa, and C-33A CCC by Flow cytometry (FC). CCC were pre-treated with SnPP or ZnPP HO-1 inhibitors. After that, NK-92 cells were co-cultured with HeLa, SiHa, and C-33A CCC pre-treated or not with HO-1 inhibitors, and the expression of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, CD107a, Granzyme B, NKp44, NKp46, NKp30, and NKG2D was evaluated by FC.\\n\\nRESULTS: CCC lines HeLa, SiHa, and C-33A expressed HO-1. Inhibition of HO-1 in these cells increased the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in CD107a\u2009+\u2009NK-92 cells. We observed a reduction in the expression of NKG2D, NKp46, and NKp30 in NK cells co-cultured with HeLa and SiHa cells, and when HeLa and SiHa cells were pre-treated with the HO-1 inhibitors, the expression of NKG2D and NKp30 in NK cells was restored. We observed a similar effect in NK cells co-cultured with C-33A cells in NKp30 expression.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Inhibition of HO-1 in CCC induces an increase in IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production in CD107a\u2009+\u2009NK-92 cells and restores NKG2D, NKp46 and NKp30 downmodulation in NK cells."

This study aims to characterize the changes in gene expression associated with chronic hypoxia in MCF7 breast cancer cell line and identify a possible biomarker for hypoxia in breast cancer. Breast cancer cells (MCF7) were exposed to 8-hour hypoxic episodes (<1% oxygen) three times a week for a total of 38 episodes. Gene expression changes were profiled using RT- PCR array after 19 and 38 episodes of hypoxia and compared to normoxic cells. Chemoresistance of hypoxic cells toward doxorubicin was assessed using MTT cell proliferation assay. Marked gene expression changes were indentified after 19 and 38 episodes of hypoxia. Only few changes were common in both stages with most genes rebounding at the level of 38 episodes. A notable gene (HNF4A) has been up-regulated by 2 folds after 19 hypoxic shots and further up-regulated by 6.43 folds after 38 hypoxic shots. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of doxorubicin in MCF7 cells has increased in a trend proportional to the number of hypoxic episodes then totally rebounded after incubation under normoxia for 3weeks. This study provides evidence that exposing cells to prolonged periods of hypoxia (weeks) results in different expression changes than those induced by short-term hypoxia (less than 72h)."

The aim of the present study was to delineate possible apoptotic pathway(s) involved in the EA-mediated chemotherapeutic effects in the LNCaP human prostatic cancer cell line. EA produced anti-proliferative effects through inhibition of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and a reduction in intracellular levels of \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, we demonstrated that EA induced apoptosis via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), human antigen R (HuR) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). EA modulated the expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) resulting in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the activation of caspase-3. Finally, we demonstrated that EA reduced both transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. EA treatment resulted in the increased expression of the tumor suppressor protein p21 and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that EA treatment represents a new and highly effective strategy in reducing prostate cancer carcinogenesis."

It is involved in amino acid metabolism and methylation processes that occur during the progression of prostate cancer. In this study, we monitored the effect of the addition of sarcosine (0; 10; 250; 500; 1,000 and 1,500\u00a0\u00b5M) in a time-dependent manner (0-72\u00a0h) on the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line. For the assessment of cell viability, the commonly used MTT test was employed. Furthermore, ion-exchange liquid chromatography was used for the determination of sarcosine content in the PC-3 cells. We also determined metallothionein (MT) levels by chip capillary electrophoresis and Brdicka reaction in the cells treated with sarcosine. Sarcosine levels in the cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner levels increased from only 270\u00a0nM with the lowest applied concentration of sarcosine (10\u00a0\u00b5M) to 106\u00a0\u00b5M with the highest applied concentration of sarcosine (1,500\u00a0\u00b5M). There was a marginal change observed in the MT concentration. Finally, the antioxidant activity of the PC-3 cells was determined using five different spectrophotometric methods [2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), free radicals, N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS)]. A significant negative correlation was observed between DPPH and FRAP (r=-0.68 at p<0.001) and between DMPD and ABST (r=-0.64 at p<0.001). Additionally, as regards the correlation between MT and DPPH, a significant positive trend (r=0.62 at p<0.001) was observed."

It promotes tumor cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, induces angiogenesis and metastasis, and suppresses antitumor host immune responses. Therefore, Stat3 has emerged as a promising molecular target for cancer therapies. In this study, we evaluated the Stat3-suppressive activity of 38 herbal medicines traditionally used in Korea. \\n\\nMETHODS\\nMedicinal herb extracts in 70% ethanol were screened for their ability to suppress Stat3 in the A549 human lung cancer cell line. A Stat3-responsive reporter assay system was used to detect intracellular Stat3 activity in extract-treated cells, and Western blot analyses were performed to measure the expression profiles of Stat3-regulated proteins. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nFifty percent of the 38 extracts possessed at least mild Stat3-suppressive activities (i.e., activity less than 75% of the vehicle control). Ethanol extracts of Bupleurum falcatum L., Taraxacum officinale Weber, Solanum nigrum L., Ulmus macrocarpa Hance, Euonymus alatus Sieb., Artemisia capillaris Thunb., and Saururus chinensis (Lour.) Baill inhibited up to 75% of the vehicle control Stat3 activity level. A549 cells treated with these extracts also had reduced Bcl-xL, Survivin, c-Myc, and Mcl-1 expression. \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nMany medicinal herbs traditionally used in Korea contain Stat3 activity-suppressing substances. Because of the therapeutic impact of Stat3 inhibition, these results could be useful when developing novel cancer therapeutics from medicinal herbs."

However, to date the effects of lipid peroxidation-derived products that are formed from fat (especially free or esterified unsaturated fatty acids) on the initiation or progression of colorectal cancer have not been investigated extensively. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of fatty acids, fatty acid hydroperoxides and aldehydes on the growth of human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29. At concentrations of 1 and 10\u00b5M, linoleic, arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic and 15-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acids had no significant effects on the growth of HT-29 cells. 4-Hydroxynonenal and 4-hydroxyhexenal had no significant effects on the growth of HT-29 cells up to 10\u00b5M, whereas 4-oxononenal potently inhibited HT-29 cell growth (110\u00b5M, 1685% inhibition). Further experiments concerning DNA fragmentation, expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA, expression levels of pro-caspase-3 and caspase-3 proteins, and activity of caspase-3 suggested that 4-oxononenal may increase the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to apoptosis through a decreased expression level of Bcl-2 and then increased formation of caspase-3 from pro-caspase-3."

STC-1 expression is upregulated in several cancers including breast cancer, and has been shown to be prognostic. Although these clinical observations implicate STC-1 as a potential tumor marker, it is still unclear whether STC-1 confers a malignant phenotype. In this study, this question was addressed by overexpressing STC-1 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and examining the resultant phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of STC-1 enhanced invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and promoted their lung metastasis in vivo, while having no effect on proliferation, adhesion, or proteinase activity. The addition of soluble STC-1 to MDA-MB-231 cultures resulted in the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanistic basis for the observed increases in cell motility and metastasis. Taken together, it was indicated that secreted STC-1 promotes metastatic potential of breast cancer cells via activation of PI3K/AKT."

        "abstract": "Regular aspirin intake is associated with a reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer. Aspirin has been shown to be cytotoxic to colorectal cancer cells in vitro. The molecular basis for this cytotoxicity is controversial, with a number of competing hypotheses in circulation. One suggestion is that the protective effect is related to the induction of expression of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6 and hPMS2 in DNA MMR proficient cells. We report that treatment of the DNA MMR competent/p53 mutant colorectal cancer cell line SW480 with 1 mM aspirin for 48 h caused changes in mRNA expression of several key genes involved in DNA damage signalling pathways, including a significant down-regulation in transcription of the genes ATR, BRCA1 and MAPK12. Increases in the transcription of XRCC3 and GADD45alpha genes are also reported. Regulation of these genes could potentially have profound effects on colorectal cancer cells and may play a role in the observed chemo-protective effect of aspirin in vivo. Although a correlation was not seen between transcript and protein levels of ATR, BRCA1 and GADD45alpha, an increase in XRCC3 encoded protein expression upon aspirin treatment in SW480 cells was observed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis. This is the first report of XRCC3 gene transcription and encoded protein expression being susceptible to exposure to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin. Furthermore, this study indicates that alterations in gene transcription seen in microarray studies must be verified at the protein level."

We created a large set of 934 high-confidence P-gp substrates or nonsubstrates by enforcing agreement with an orthogonal criterion involving P-gp overexpressing ADR-RES cells. A support vector machine (SVM) was 86.7% accurate in discriminating P-gp substrates on independent test data, exceeding previous models. Two molecular features had an overarching influence: nearly all P-gp substrates were large (>35 atoms including H) and dense (specific volume of <7.3 \u00c5(3)/atom) molecules. Seven other descriptors and 24 molecular fragments (\"effluxophores\") were found enriched in the (non)substrates and incorporated into interpretable rule-based models. Biological experiments on an independent P-gp overexpressing cell line, the vincristine-resistant VK2, allowed us to reclassify six compounds previously annotated as substrates, validating our method's predictive ability.

In previous studies it was shown that camptothecin causes ROS formation. The aim of this study was to investigate if Topotecan like camptotecin causes oxidative stress in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Determining the oxidant effect of Topotecan may elucidate a possible alternative mechanism for its cytotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MCF-7 cells were cultured and exposed to Topotecan for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The viability of the cells (% of control) was measured using the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Lipid peroxidation (TBARS), protein oxidation (carbonyl content), sulfhydryl, glutathione (GSH) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were determined in MCF-7 cells with and without Topotecan incubation. RESULTS: We found the IC(50) concentration of Topotecan as 0.218 microM in MCF-7 cells. This concentration of Topotecan was used in the incubations of the cells. Our data indicated increased oxidative status, as revealed by increased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, and decreased GSH and sulfhydryl levels in MCF-7 cells exposed to Topotecan compared to control cells. In contrast, there was a slight increase in SOD and a significant increase in GPx and catalase activity in MCF-7 cells incubated with Topotecan compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: These results support our hypothesis that Topotecan increases oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ezrin targeting gene of RNA interference (RNAi) on human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 in vitro.\\n\\nMETHODS: The highly metastatic human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 transfected with a small interfering (siRNA) lentivirus vector was selected for this research study. Expressions of ezrin mRNA and ezrin protein in the SGC-7901 cells were detected using RT-PCR and Western blot. Cell apoptosis was observed using flow cytometry. Transwell invasion and the cell adhesion test were used to verify the effect of RNAi on ezrin expression in the human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 in vitro.\\n\\nRESULTS: Ezrin gene targeting via a RNAi-mediated lentivirus vector had obvious inhibitory effects on ezrin expression in the human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901. The results of the RT-PCR show the obvious inhibition of ezrin mRNA expression in Eai and Ebi groups (0.22 +/- 0.01 vs 0.95 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05; 0.31 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05). Western blot analysis revealed a 72.35 +/- 3.74% reduction of the ezrin protein level after interference with the ezrin targeting gene. Moreover, the inhibition of ezrin expression clearly inhibited SGC-7901 cell migration and invasion, and improved cell adhesion as well as increased sensitivity to camptothecin-induced apoptosis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Ezrin gene targeting by RNAi can inhibit the metastatic growth and migration of SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells."

Cell growth and viability were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and electron microscopy. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bcl-2, CD31, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in tumour tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry. The drug concentration that yielded 50% cell inhibition (IC(50) value) was 4.74 mu g mL(-1). In the PC-3 tumour xenograft study, (-)-gossypol (> 5 mg kg(-1)) given once a day for 7 days significantly inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that (-)-gossypol enhanced caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression and decreased the expression of PCNA, Bcl-2 and CD31 in tumour tissues. It suggested that cell apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis might contribute to the anticancer action of (-)-gossypol."

It also has one of the lowest possibilities of cure, with the 5-year survival rate estimated to be only 10% overall. Sutherlandia frutescens, or the \"cancer bush\", is a medicinal plant indigenous to southern Africa that is believed to have anti-cancer and anti-proliferative properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential apoptosis-inducing effects of two S. frutescens extracts and one Sutherlandia tomentosa extract on the SNO oesophageal cancer cell line. Materials and methods: Cell viability and morphology of SNO cells were evaluated following exposure to the extracts. Apoptotic markers including cytochrome c translocation and phosphatidylserine externalisation were quantified by flow cytometry. The activity of caspases 3 and 7 was evaluated with spectrofluorometry. Apoptosis was evaluated in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk. The effect of the extracts was compared to non-cancerous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: Time- and dose-response studies were conducted to establish treatment conditions of 2.5 and 5 mg/ml of crude plant extracts. Microscopy studies revealed that S. frutescens- and S. tomentosa-treated SNO cells had morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. Annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry confirmed that the extracts do, in fact, induce apoptosis in the SNO cells. Caspase inhibition studies seem to indicate that extracts A (S. frutescens (L.) R. Br. subsp. microphylla from Colesberg), B (S. frutescens (L.) R. Br. subsp. microphylla from Platvlei) and C (S. tomentosa Eckl. & Zeyh from Stil Bay) are able to induce caspase-dependent as well as -independent cell death. The S. frutescens and S. tomentosa extracts were found to be more cytotoxic to cancerous SNO cells when compared to the PBMCs. Conclusions: S. frutescens and S. tomentosa extracts show promise as apoptosis-inducing anti-cancer agents. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "We investigated the presence of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) as well as the role of glucocorticoids (Gc) in the control of proliferation of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU145. We detected the presence of a specific high affinity binding site (K(d) 2.3 nM) for [(3)H]dexamethasone ([(3)H]Dex) in the cytosolic preparations of DU145 cells; the density of these binding sites is significantly higher than that detected in HA22T/VGH and in HepG2, two hepatoma cell lines classically considered models for the study of GR. Immunocytochemistry studies confirmed the presence of GR in the cytosolic compartment of DU145 cells; GR undergo translocation to the nucleus following exposure to dexamethasone (Dex). The functional activity of GR present in DU145 cells was also studied by analyzing the potency of Dex in inducing chloramphenicol acyltransferase (CAT) activity in DU145 cells transfected with a glucocorticoid/progesterone response element (GRE/PRE) tkCAT plasmid (GRE/PREtkCAT plasmid). The results have shown that Dex stimulates the transcriptional activity of GR in transfected DU145 cells with an EC(50) of 9.65 nM and a maximal induction of sevenfold above basal levels. Finally, a dose-dependent (IC(50) 3.14 nM) decrease of DU145 cell numbers was observed after their exposure to Dex for 4 days; this effect was counteracted by the presence of the steroid antagonist, RU486. In conclusion, the present data suggest a possible role of corticoids in the control of the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the combination of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and adriamycin (ADM) on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and to identify potential mechanisms of apoptosis. Cell viability was analyzed by the MTT assay and the synergistic effect was assessed by the Webb coefficient. Apoptosis was quantified using the annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of TRAIL receptors was measured by RT-PCR. Changes in the quantities of Bax and caspase-9 proteins were determined by Western blot. MCF-7 cells were relatively resistant to TRAIL (IC50 >10 microg/mL), while MCF-7 cells were sensitive to ADM (IC50 <10 microg/mL). A subtoxic concentration of ADM (0.5 microg/mL) combined with 0.1, 1, or 10 microg/mL TRAIL had a synergistic cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cells, which was more marked with the combination of TRAIL (0.1 microg/mL) and ADM (0.5 microg/mL). In addition, the combined treatment with TRAIL and ADM significantly increased cell apoptosis from 9.8% (TRAIL) or 17% (ADM) to 38.7%, resulting in a synergistic apoptotic effect, which is proposed to be mediated by up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 mRNA expression and increased expression of Bax and caspase-9 proteins. These results suggest that the combination of TRAIL and ADM might be a promising therapy for breast cancer."

However, the pattern and biological role of miR-183 in pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we have reported the reduction in pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro by miR-183 intervention, by inducing apoptosis and decreasing the Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, miR-183 was observed to enhance pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas inhibition of miR-183 caused an opposite effect. miR-183 inhibition was shown to increase E-cadherin expression and decrease N-cadherin expression. These regulatory actions play an important role in the cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-183 decreased the expression of PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) mRNA and protein, and vice versa. This helped to identify PDCD4 as the target genes in pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, our analyses indicated miR-183 to be an important contributor to cell migration. This could also be used as a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment."

        "abstract": "There is evidence that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP-2), a modulator of the actions of IGFs, also has IGF-independent effects in human tumor cell lines. These involve specific binding of IGFBP-2 to alpha5beta1-integrin, followed by alterations in the phosphorylation status of downstream signaling molecules. Previously, IGFBP-2 has also been shown to be associated with cell proliferation, adhesion and migration. Here, we investigated direct effects of IGFBP-2 on apoptosis and alterations in the expression of related proteins. The breast cancer cell line Hs578T, which shows no IGFBP-2 production of its own and is independent of the IGF-I receptor, was treated with human recombinant IGFBP-2 in order to study the changes in gene expression induced by IGFBP-2. The methods employed for this purpose were oligonucleotide microarrays, real-time RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunoassays. Out of the 440 genes covered by the Oligo GEArray Human Cancer Microarray OHS-802, the expression of 77 genes was directly influenced by IGFBP-2. By the use of real-time quantitative RT-PCR, the gene expression of Nuclear Factor (NF)kappaB, p53, transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta-1), LAMB1 (Laminin, Beta 1), Bcl-2, and IIp45 was found to be significantly upregulated (by 1.2- to 3.05-fold; all P < 0.001). Accordingly, NFkappaB, p53, and TGF beta-1 proteins, as measured by Western blotting and immunoassay, were upregulated > 1.5-fold. By using an ELISA-based and a flow cytometry-based apoptosis assay, IGFBP-2 was found to have a pro-apoptotic effect on Hs578T cells. Our results suggest that IGFBP-2-induced gene expressions are of functional significance for proliferation, cell adhesion, cell migration and apoptosis, and showed that IGFBP-2 can promote apoptosis in tumor cells independent of IGF."

The extract was obtained using phosphate buffered saline. MTS assay and Annexin V assay were performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect and apoptotic effect, respectively. The extract was found to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells (IC50=15.6 \u00b5g/ml) and induced apoptosis (52.9% after 1 h treatment and 63.9% after 2 h treatment). This apoptotic effect was more potent and earlier than the apoptotic effect induced by tamoxifen.

Many cell lines have been derived from LNCaP by selective pressures to study different aspects of prostate cancer progression. When injected subcutaneously into male athymic nude mice, LNCaP and its derivatives rarely metastasize. METHODS: Here, we describe the characteristics of a new LNCaP derivative, JHU-LNCaP-SM, which was generated by long term passage in normal cell culture conditions. RESULTS: Short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and genomic sequencing verified JHU-LNCaP-SM derivation from parental LNCaP cells. JHU-LNCaP-SM cells express the same mutated androgen receptor (AR) but unlike LNCaP, are no longer androgen dependent for growth. The cells demonstrate an attenuated androgen responsiveness in transcriptional assays and retain androgen sensitive expression of PSA, AR, and PSMA. Unlike parental LNCaP, JHU-LNCaP-SM cells quickly form subcutaneous tumors in male athymic nude mice, reliably metastasize to the lymph nodes and display a striking intra-tumoral and spreading hemorrhagic phenotype as tumor xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: The JHU-LNCaP-SM cell line is a new isolate of LNCaP, which facilitates practical, preclinical studies of spontaneous metastasis of prostate cancer through lymphatic tissues.

The methods described here involve a real-time, less invasive technique for detecting mesothelin, a protein that has been linked to pancreatic and ovarian cancer. METHODS: Antibodies were immobilized on the gold surface of the device via a self-assembled alkanethiol monolayer. Supernatant from two different pancreatic cancer cell-lines (PL1 and CAPAN2) containing an unknown concentration of mesothelin was tested for the protein by a flow-through analytical technique in three types of experiments. Binding of the mesothelin to the immobilized antibody layer caused a shift in the device's resonant frequency, which was correlated to the concentration of supernatant. A reference sensor was used to correct for frequency shifts caused by pressure or viscosity effects from the injection of the supernatant solution. RESULTS: Repeated experiments indicate that the sensors are capable of nanogram detection thresholds of mesothelin proteins at room temperature and in complex mixture. CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic wave device biosensors have the potential to become a valuable tool in screening for pancreatic as well as other types of cancers. The main features include real-time detection, high sensitivity, and ease of use."

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that garlic oil (GO) and its anti-tumor compound could inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis in human cancer cells. In order to explore the effects of garlic oil on carcinoma cells, a gastric carcinoma cell line, BGC-823 was studied at cellular and molecular levels after garlic oil treatment. Data showed that the cell differentiation and suppression of tumorigenicity were significantly induced in tumor cells after garlic oil treatment. There was a correlation between the cell-cell communication recovery and the increase of p53 and waf1/p21 gene expression in garlic oil-treated cells. This result suggested that tumor suppressor gene waf1/p21 and wt p53 might play an important role in this effect."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on proliferation of basal-like breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 cells and Akt phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: APS at different concentrations was used to culture MDA-MB-468 cells for different time periods, and then proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells was assayed using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay to determine the time- and dose-dependent effects of APS. For observing the effects of APS on phosphor-Akt (p-Akt), in-cell Western blot method was used after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of culture in APS to detect protein expressions of p-Akt (Thr308) and p-Akt (Ser473). Protein levels of the key targets in p53/murine double minute 2 (MDM2) signaling pathway, such as p53, MDM2 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) were also detected. After PTEN gene was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in MDA-MB-468 cells, expressions of p-Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) were assayed by the in-cell Western blot method after 2 d of APS treatment.\\n\\nRESULTS: APS at 1 and 0.5 mg/mL concentrations effectively inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells and was used in subsequent tests. Compared with the control group, APS decreased the protein expression of p-Akt (Thr308) in MDA-MB-468 cells after 1-, 2-, 4- and 7-day culture, and also decreased the protein expression of p-Akt (Ser473) and up-regulated the protein expression of MDM2 in MDA-MB-468 cells after 1- and 2-day culture. Expressions of p53 and PTEN were up-regulated after 7 d of APS culture. After silencing PTEN gene by siRNA, APS could not mediate Akt phosphorylation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: APS can inhibit proliferation of basal-like breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468, and down-regulate the expression of Akt phosphorylation. The antiproliferation mechanisms may be related to its effects of up-regulating the expressions of p53 and PTEN by regulating p53/MDM2 positive and negative feedback loops."

To address this problem, we studied the precursor cells of metastases directly for the identification of prognostic and therapeutic markers and prospectively analyzed single disseminated cancer cells from lymph nodes and bone marrow of 107 consecutive esophageal cancer patients. Whole-genome screening revealed that primary tumors and lymphatically and hematogenously disseminated cancer cells diverged for most genetic aberrations. However, we identified chromosome 17q12-21, the region comprising HER2, as the most frequent gain in disseminated tumor cells that were isolated from both ectopic sites. Survival analysis demonstrated that HER2 gain in a single disseminated tumor cell but not in primary tumors conferred high risk for early death. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The properties like poor water solubility and limited oral bio-availability of ellagic acid has hampered its clinical applications. The present study, reports the preparation of ellagic acid encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (EA@CS-NP) by ionic gelation method as an effective drug delivery for oral cancer treatment. The synthesized ellagic acid nanoparticle is spherical shaped with an average particle size of 176nm. The drug-encapsulation and loading-efficiency of the nanoparticles were 94??1.03% and 33??2.15% respectively. The in vitro drug release profile in the PBS medium shows sustained release of EA from EA@CS-NP. Further, this study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of EA@CS-NP in human oral cancer cell line (KB) using MTT and DNA fragmentation analysis. EA@CS-NP exhibit significant cytotoxicity in KB cells in a dose-dependent manner with a very low IC50 value compared to the free EA. The results of the present study strengthen our hypothesis and hope that this novel formulation could possibly overcome the current limitations of ellagic acid and can open a new avenue for oral cancer therapy. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V."

        "abstract": "We show in the present work that the infrared (IR) spectrum of human PC-3 prostate cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs could offer a unique opportunity to get a fingerprint of all the major biochemical components (DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, etc.) present in the cells and to identify with high sensitivity the signature of the metabolic changes induced by anticancer drugs. We investigated here the FTIR-related signatures of the effect of 4 structurally-related cardiotonic steroids (CS), i.e. ouabain, 19-hydroxy-2\"-oxovoruscharin, hellebrin and 19-hydroxy-hellebrin on PC-3 cancer cells incubated between 0 and 36. h in the absence (control) or the presence of the CS. For each molecule a single spectral signature described the largest part of the time dependent modifications with a possible very minor second component. The spectral signatures characterizing the effects of each of the four CS were unique but very similar when compared to the signature of the effect of an intercalating anticancer drug, i.e. doxorubicin, selected as a positive reference compound in our study, suggesting a fully distinct set of cellular perturbations. The current study thus illustrates that Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses can be used to identify, among the perturbations induced on a given cancer cell line, the features common to a group of anticancer compounds as well as features specific to every single drug. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V."

Here, we screened putative associations between 34, 45, and 103 miRNAs and 164, 391, and 81 mRNAs via Argonaute1 (Ago1) or Ago2 immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments in a colon cancer cell line. We used a combination of RIP Seq analysis. RNAs that were co-immunoprecipitated with Ago1 or Ago2 were used for massively parallel small RNA and mRNA sequencing. The detected miRNAs and mRNAs were further associated with one another based on in silico target predictions. Analysis of the putative associations indicated that, although Ago1 and Ago2 shared a similar repertory of miRNAs, the mRNAs possibly regulated by those miRNAs seemed different. The mRNAs detected with Ago1 IP were indicated to be frequently associated with genes having constitutive cellular functions, regulated by a smaller number of miRNAs, and appeared to receive more stringent translational regulation. In contrast, putative miRNA-mRNA associations detected with Ago2 IP appeared to be related to signal transduction genes, which had a larger number of possible miRNA binding sites. We then conducted a similar analysis using the colon cancer cells cultured under hypoxia and identified potential hypoxia-induced miRNA-mRNA associations, which included several well-characterized cancer-related genes as novel putative miRNA targets. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V."

        "abstract": "The estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line has been used extensively for the study of estrogen-responsive human breast cancer. However, various levels of estrogen responsiveness have been described in different stocks of MCF-7 cells. Because we have previously shown that the pineal hormone, melatonin, inhibits proliferation of MCF-7 cells and can modulate ER expression and transactivation, we investigated if various stocks of MCF-7 cells exhibit a differential responsiveness to the anti-proliferative effects of melatonin and the possible mechanisms involved. The MCF-7 stocks (M, O, H) were examined for: (1) mitogenic response to estradiol; (2) steady-state ER mRNA levels; (3) expression of the mt1 melatonin membrane receptor; (4) growth inhibition by melatonin; and (5) melatonin's modulation of expression of the ER and the estrogen-regulated genes, PgR, TGF\u03b2 and pS2. For all of these parameters, there was a stock-specific response which showed: MCF-7(M) > MCF-7(O) > MCF-7(H). These results demonstrate that there are significant differences in the responsiveness of various stocks of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to the growth-inhibitory effects of melatonin which can be correlated with both the level of ER mRNA expression and the degree of estrogen-responsiveness. These findings suggest that not only may these differences have some impact on the cells' estrogen-response pathway, but also that the primary growth-inhibitory effects of melatonin are transduced through the membrane-associated G-protein coupled mt1 melatonin receptor."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) hypothesis asserts that only a small subset of cells within a tumour is capable of both tumour initiation and sustainment. The Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is an embryonic developmental program that is often activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study is to shed light on the relationship between EMT and CSCs by using LC31 lung cancer primary cell line.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A549 and LC31 cell lines were treated with 2 ng/ml TGF\u03b2-1 for 30 days, and 80 days, respectively. To evaluate EMT, morphological changes were assessed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence and cytometry for following markers: cytokeratins, e-cadherin, CD326 (epithelial markers) and CD90, and vimentin (mesenchymal markers). Moreover, RT-PCR for Slug, Twist and \u03b2-catenin genes were performed. On TGF\u03b2-1 treated and untreated LC31 cell lines, we performed stemness tests such as pneumospheres growth and stem markers expression such as Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, c-kit and CD133. Western Blot for CD133 and tumorigenicity assays using NOD/SCID mice were performed.\\n\\nRESULTS: TGF\u03b2-1 treated LC31 cell line lost its epithelial morphology assuming a fibroblast-like appearance. The same results were obtained for the A549 cell line (as control). Immunofluorescence and cytometry showed up-regulation of vimentin and CD90 and down-regulation of cytocheratin, e-cadherin and CD326 in TGF\u03b2-1 treated LC31 and A549 cell lines. Slug, Twist and \u03b2-catenin m-RNA transcripts were up-regulated in TGF\u03b2-1 treated LC31 cell line confirming EMT. This cell line showed also over-expression of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and CD133, all genes of stemness. In addition, in TGF\u03b2-1 treated LC31 cell line, an increased pneumosphere-forming capacity and tumours-forming ability in NOD/SCID mice were detectable.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The induction of EMT by TGF\u03b2-1 exposure, in primary lung cancer cell line results in the acquisition of mesenchymal profile and in the expression of stem cell markers."

METHODS: To confirm the subtype of melatonin on Ishikawa cells, cells were treated with melatonin alone and with antagonists against melatonin receptor luzindole and 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin (4-P-PDOT). Expression of MT1/MT2 mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunocytochemistry of MT1/MT2 was also performed. The effect of melatonin against expression of MT1, MT2, and ERalpha-receptors mRNA was compared with RT-PCR. To determine whether melatonin enhances the effect of anticancer agents, chemosensitivity test was performed with or without melatonin. RESULTS: Our study revealed that Ishikawa cells express MT1 by both RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. In contrast, expression of MT2 mRNA was not found. Furthermore, ERalpha mRNA expression was attenuated at melatonin level of 1 x 10(-9) M. Chemosensitivity test revealed that melatonin enhanced anti-tumor effects of paclitaxel among anticancer drugs tested. CONCLUSION: Based on the above results, MT1 receptor, but not MT2, is expressed in Ishikawa cells. It was also revealed that the cytostatic effect of melatonin is partly an action mediated by MT1 receptor, and attenuation of ERalpha expression was predicted as the mechanism of action. Clinical application of melatonin to biochemotherapy might be also expected."

This paper also reports the in vivo pharmacological effect of these steroidal molecules. The results from this study showed that all compounds exhibited low inhibitory activity for 5??-reductase type 1 and 2 enzymes and they failed to bind to the androgen receptor. Furthermore, in the in vivo experiment, steroids 3b, 4f, and 4g showed comparable antiandrogenic activity to that of finasteride; only derivatives 4d and 7 produced a considerable decrease in the weight of the prostate gland of gonadectomized hamsters treated with (T). On the other hand, compounds 4a, f and h showed 100% inhibition of the growth of prostate cancer cell line PC-3, with compound 4g having a 98.2% antiproliferative effect at 50 ??M. The overall data indicated that these steroidal molecules, having an aromatic ester moiety at C-3 (4f-h), could have anticancer properties."

        "abstract": "To evaluate whether leptin plays a putative role in breast tumorigenesis, we studied the expression of its long and short receptor isoforms in various tumoral breast tissues. We applied semiquantitative RT-PCR method to RNA extracted from 20 breast cancer biopsies and two human breast cancer cell lines (T47-D and MCF-7). Our results showed the expression of both leptin receptor transcripts in all tumoral tissues examined. By in situ hybridization experiments, we localized leptin receptors in proliferating epithelial cells. Study of leptin effects on human breast cancer cells growth was performed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation method and colorimetric MTT assay. We demonstrated that leptin (50-100 ng/ml) significantly stimulates proliferation of the human breast cancer cell line T47-D (P<0.05). Western blot analysis indicated that leptin induces a time-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKinase) 1 and 2 in T47-D cell line. Moreover, the specific MAPK-inhibitor PD 98059 blocked cell proliferation induced by leptin. In conclusion, we demonstrate that leptin receptors are expressed in breast cancer and that leptin induces proliferation in the T47-D cell line via activation of the MAPKinases pathway. These data suggest that leptin and its receptors may be implicated in mammary cell proliferation and in breast cancer pathogenesis."

Because telomerase activity is involved in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of raloxifene on estrogen-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Raloxifene inhibited the induction of cell growth and telomerase activity by 17beta-estradiol (E2). Raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced expression of the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT), and transient expression assays using luciferase reporter plasmids containing various fragments of the hTERT promoter showed that the estrogen-responsive element appeared to be partially responsible for the action of raloxifene.

Raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced Akt phosphorylation. In addition, raloxifene also inhibited the E2-induced hTERT expression via the PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB cascade. Moreover, raloxifene also inhibited the E2-induced phosphorylation of hTERT, association of NFkappaB with hTERT, and nuclear accumulation of hTERT.

        "abstract": "Here we describe the comprehensive gene expression profiles of each cell type composing normal breast tissue and in situ and invasive breast carcinomas using serial analysis of gene expression. Based on these data, we determined that extensive gene expression changes occur in all cell types during cancer progression and that a significant fraction of altered genes encode secreted proteins and receptors. Despite the dramatic gene expression changes in all cell types, genetic alterations were detected only in cancer epithelial cells. The CXCL14 and CXCL12 chemokines overexpressed in tumor myoepithelial cells and myofibroblasts, respectively, bind to receptors on epithelial cells and enhance their proliferation, migration, and invasion. Thus, chemokines may play a role in breast tumorigenesis by acting as paracrine factors."

This has been used to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells, but how the spindle checkpoint couples to the cell survival machinery has remained elusive. Here, we report that microtubule stabilization engenders a survival pathway that depends on elevated activity of p34 cdc2 kinase and increased expression of the apoptosis inhibitor and mitotic regulator, survivin. Pharmacologic, genetic, or molecular ablation of p34cdc2 kinase after microtubule stabilization resulted in massive apoptosis independent of p53, suppression of tumor growth, and indefinite survival without toxicity in mice. By ablating this survival checkpoint, inhibitors of p34cdc2 kinase could safely improve the efficacy of microtubule-stabilizing agents used to treat common cancers. Copyright ?? 2002 Cell Press."

Here, we show that platelet-tumor cell interactions are sufficient to prime tumor cells for subsequent metastasis. Platelet-derived TGF\u03b2 and direct platelet-tumor cell contacts synergistically activate the TGF\u03b2/Smad and NF-\u03baB pathways in cancer cells, resulting in their transition to an invasive mesenchymal-like phenotype and enhanced metastasis in\u00a0vivo. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling in cancer cells or ablation of TGF\u03b21 expression solely in platelets protects against lung\u00a0metastasis in\u00a0vivo. Thus, cancer cells rely on platelet-derived signals outside of the primary tumor for efficient metastasis. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the antiproliferative activity of contragestazol (DL111-IT) on the human prostate cancer cell line PC3 in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate its potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The cell killing ability of DL111-IT was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthia-zol,2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent assay method and the tumor xenograft model. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry and protein expression, including retinoblastoma (pRb), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1, was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: DL111-IT exhibited high efficiency on cell growth inhibition of the human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC3. The drug concentration that yielded 50% cell inhibition (IC50 value) was 9.9 mg/mL. In the PC3 tumor xenograft study, DL111-IT (1.25 mg/kg-20.0 mg/kg) given once a day for 10 days significantly inhibited tumor growth, with the inhibition rate ranging from 21% to 50%. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that DL111-IT could cause G1 arrest in the PC3 cell line, but not apoptosis. DL111-IT enhanced pRb expression and down-regulated CDK4 and cyclin D1 expression, suggesting that cell cycle regulation might contribute to the anticancer property of DL111-IT. CONCLUSION: DL111-IT inhibits the proliferation of human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC3 in vitro and in vivo by a cell cycle regulation pathway."

High expression of NEK2 induced drug resistance mainly through activation of the efflux pumps. Thus, NEK2 represents a strong predictor for drug resistance and poor prognosis in cancer and could be an important target for cancer therapy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

We report an RNA interference screen to identify genes influencing sensitivity of different cancer cell types to chemotherapeutic agents. A set of genes whose targeting leads to resistance to paclitaxel is identified, many of which are involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Silencing these genes attenuates paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest and induces polyploidy in the absence of drug. We also identify a ceramide transport protein, COL4A3BP or CERT, whose downregulation sensitizes cancer cells to multiple cytotoxic agents, potentiating endoplasmic reticulum stress. COL4A3BP expression is increased in drug-resistant cell lines and in residual tumor following paclitaxel treatment of ovarian cancer, suggesting that it could be a target for chemotherapy-resistant cancers. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "This report describes the profiling of proteins in a sample prepared by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from a breast cancer cell line (SKBR-3). This experimental approach serves as a model system for proteomic studies on selected tissue samples and for studies of specific cell types. The captured cells were isolated in a dehydrated and reduced state and solubilized with a denaturing buffer. After dilution the protein mixture was digested with trypsin and the resulting peptide mixture was fractionated by reversed phase HPLC (RPLC) and analyzed on an ion trap mass spectrometer. A key part of this study is the combination of the LCM process with an extraction/digestion procedure that allowed effective solubilization of a significant part of the cellular sample in a single step. The identity of the peptides was determined by tandem mass spectrometry measurements in which the resulting spectra were compared with genomic and proteomic databases and protein identifications were made. While only peptides with a high probability assignment were used, the interpretation of mass spectral fragmentation patterns were also confirmed by manual interpretation of the spectra. Also, for the more abundant proteins the initial protein assignment from the best match peptide was strengthened by the observation of additional confirmatory peptide identifications. Another selection criteria was correlation of the mass spectrometric studies with clinical and genomic studies of potential cancer markers in tumor samples. This proteomic study allowed identification of the following proteins: human receptor protein kinase HER-2 or ERBB-2 and related kinases HER-3 and HER-4, the gene products from breast cancer type I and II susceptibility genes and cytoskeletal components such as cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19. Other proteins include fibroblast growth factor receptor variants (FGFR-2&4) and T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing protein 1 (TIAM1). In addition several nonreceptor protein kinases YES, FAK and JAK-1 and 3 were identified. Since the study was performed on a limited number of cells (approximately 10,000) it raises the possibility of such studies being performed on individual patient samples prepared by needle biopsy."

The growth inhibitory effect was evaluated by MTT assay as a monotherapy or combination therapy. IC(50) values were determined using CalcuSyn 2.0 software. To determine the interaction of the drugs, the combination index (CI) was calculated using the Chou-Talalay method. Apoptosis was investigated using flow cytometry and Western blotting. Acridine orange staining was employed to observe morphological changes. The results showed the IC(50) values of L-OHP and RAPA to be 8.35\u00b10.78 \u03bcM (r=0.99) and 223.44\u00b138.10 nM (r=0.94), respectively. CI was \u22641 when L-OHP was used at doses ranging from 1 to 5 \u03bcM plus RAPA at a dose of 10 nM, suggesting synergistic or additive effects. CI was \u22651 when 100 nM RAPA was used in combination with low-dose L-OHP, showing additive to antagonistic effects. The combination of L-OHP (1 \u03bcM) and RAPA (10 nM) induced 19.76% Annexin V-positive cells, which was found to be higher than L-OHP (11.45%, p<0.01) or RAPA (6.89%, p<0.01) alone. The cleaved PARP protein expression levels were highest after 48 h of combination treatment. Acridine orange staining showed typical bright red Acidic vesicular organelles in the RAPA group, whereas the green condensed chromatin in the apoptotic bodies was found in both the L-OHP and combination groups. In conclusion, at a cytostatic concentration, RAPA was found to potentiate the anti-tumor effects of low-dose L-OHP in the HCT116 colon cancer cell by inducing enhanced apoptosis."

YC-1 inhibited NCI-H226 cell growth in a time- and a concentration-dependent manner. YC-1 suppressed the protein levels of cyclin D1, CDK2 and cdc25A, up-regulated p16, p21 and p53, increased the number of NCI-H226 cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Long exposure to YC-1 induced apoptosis by mitochondrial-dependent pathway. In addition, YC-1 inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein activities to abolish tumor cells metastasis. These findings suggest a mechanism of cytotoxic action of YC-1 and indicate that YC-1 may be a promising chemotherapy agent against lung cancer. ?? 2007."

        "abstract": "Aberrations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors frequently affect the activity of critical signal transduction pathways. To analyze systematically the relationship between the activation status of protein networks and other characteristics of cancer cells, we did reverse phase protein array (RPPA) profiling of the NCI60 cell lines for total protein expression and activation-specific markers of critical signaling pathways. To extend the scope of the study, we merged those data with previously published RPPA results for the NCI60. Integrative analysis of the expanded RPPA data set revealed five major clusters of cell lines and five principal proteomic signatures. Comparison of mutations in the NCI60 cell lines with patterns of protein expression showed significant associations for PTEN, PIK3CA, BRAF, and APC mutations with proteomic clusters. PIK3CA and PTEN mutation enrichment were not cell lineage-specific but were associated with dominant yet distinct groups of proteins. The five RPPA-defined clusters were strongly associated with sensitivity to standard anticancer agents. RPPA analysis identified 27 protein features significantly associated with sensitivity to paclitaxel. The functional status of those proteins was interrogated in a paclitaxel whole genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library synthetic lethality screen and confirmed the predicted associations with drug sensitivity. These studies expand our understanding of the activation status of protein networks in the NCI60 cancer cell lines, demonstrate the importance of the direct study of protein expression and activation, and provide a basis for further studies integrating the information with other molecular and pharmacological characteristics of cancer."

Experimental studies have shown that As exposure induces cell proliferation in the bladder of sodium arsenite (iAsIII) subchronically treated mice. However, there is little available information on its effects on the cell cycle of bladder cells. Thus, our purpose was to evaluate the effects of iAsIII on cell cycle progression and the response of p53 and p21 on the human-derived epithelial bladder cell line HT1197. iAsIII treatment (1-10 ??M) for 24 h induced a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of cells in S-phase, which reached 65% at the highest dose. A progressive reduction in cell proliferation was also observed. BrdU was incorporated to cellular DNA in an interrupted form, suggesting an incomplete DNA synthesis. The time-course of iAsIII effects (10 ??M) showed an increase in p53 protein content and a transient increase in p21 protein levels accompanying the changes in S-phase. These effects were correlated with iAs concentrations inside the cells, which were not able to metabolize inorganic arsenic. Our findings suggest that p21 was not able to block CDK2-cyclin E complex activity and was therefore unable to arrest cells in G1 allowing their progression into the S-phase. Further studies are needed to ascertain the mechanisms underlying the effects of iAsIII on the G1 to S phase transition in bladder cells. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

There were clear differences in gene expression profiles. Both of the clones showed a marked increase in the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, including genes participating in nucleotide excision repair and mismatch repair. This was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analysis and was associated with an increase in the ability of p73alpha-expressing clones to repair two different DDP (cis-dichlorodiammine platinum)-damaged plasmids in a host reactivation assay. p73alpha overexpressing clones were less sensitive than parental cells to alkylating agents treatment or UV radiation but equally sensitive to the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, which indicated that the increase in expression of DNA repair genes has implications for the response to DNA damaging agents."

The aim of this study was to investigate depressive effects on JMJD2A by transfection with JMJD2A-sepcific siRNA in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and effects on cell proliferation, invasion and migration. JMJD2A-specific siRNA was chemically synthesised and transfected into human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Expression levels of JMJD2A were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Cells proliferation was evaluated by using flow cytometric anlysis and MTT assay. The abilities of invasion and migration were evaluated by cell migration and invasion assay with Boyden chambers. The results showed that the transfection was successful and expression levels of JMJD2A mRNA and protein in siRNA group were both down-regulated. By MTT assay, the mean actual absorbance in siRNA group was significantly lower than that in blank control group (P < 0.05) and negative control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase in siRNA group was significantly more than that in blank control group (P < 0.05) and negative control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, by cell invasion and migration assay, the decreased number of migrated cells in siRNA group was observed (P < 0.05). These data imply that silencing JMJD2A gene could result in cell cycle change and proliferation inhibition, and lead to suppress tumor cell invasion and migration. It provides a new perspective in understanding the pleiotropic functions of JMJD2A and its contribution to human breast cancer."

Tumorigenesis allows T cell recognition of the prostate gland - but this recognition is tolerogenic, resulting in abortive proliferation and ultimately in hyporesponsiveness at the systemic level. Androgen ablation (the most common treatment for metastatic prostate cancer) was able to mitigate this tolerance - allowing prostate-specific T cells to expand and develop effector function after vaccination.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nowadays, we believe that cancer is a genetic disease. We focus on the genetic targets and epigenetic changes in a tumor. Remarkably, many crucial signal pathways in a malignant cell involve \"stem-ness\" genes. The prevalence of stem-ness in cancer suggests that cancer has a stem-cell origin and is a stem-cell disease.\\n\\nPRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The observation that many innate stem-ness properties are easily interchangeable with malignant hallmarks needs to be further elucidated. There appears to be a malignant potential in every stem cell and a stem cell potential in every malignant cell. I hypothesize that cancer is a stem-cell disease rather than a genetic disease.\\n\\nTESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: We will use homeobox genes to endow a certain progenitor cell with specific stem-ness properties and confer different stem-cell phenotypes to the particular cell type in a hierarchical manner. We will demonstrate that an earlier homeobox gene plus a genetic defect (such as Pten loss) tend to form a more virulent tumor, while a later homeobox gene plus the same genetic defect tend to express a more indolent phenotype. Importantly, we will show that in clinically relevant cancer subtypes, those with worse clinical outcomes may paradoxically harbor fewer genetic mutations than those with better outcomes do.\\n\\nIMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The recognition that cancer is a stem-cell disease will instigate major paradigm shifts in our basic understanding of cancer. Many fundamental principles of oncology, such as multistep carcinogenesis, need to be reconciled. The realization that cancer is a stem-cell disease will also have profound clinical implications on personalized care. Many aspects of our current clinical trials need to be reevaluated."

We develop an analytic pipeline and visualization tool (metabolograms) to bridge the gap between TCGA transcriptomic profiling and our metabolomic data, which enables us to assemble an integrated pathway-level metabolic atlas and to demonstrate discordance between transcriptome and metabolome.

        "abstract": "Amygdalin, a naturally occurring substance, has been suggested to be efficacious as an anticancer substance. The effect of amygdalin on cervical cancer cells has never been studied. In this study, we found that the viability of human cervical cancer HeLa cell line was significantly inhibited by amygdalin. 4,6-Diamino-2-phenyl indole (DAPI) staining showed that amygdalin-treated HeLa cells developed typical apoptotic changes. The development of apoptosis in the amygdalin-treated HeLa cells were confirmed by double staining of amygdalin-treated HeLa cells with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) along with increase in caspase-3 activity in these cells. Further studies indicated that antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated whereas proapoptotic Bax protein was upregulated in the amygdalin-treated HeLa cells implying involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. In vivo, amygdalin administration inhibited the growth of HeLa cell xenografts through a mechanism of apoptosis. The results in the present study suggest that amygdalin may offer a new therapeutic option for patients with cervical cancer."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and its receptor (GnRHR) are both expressed by a number of malignant tumors, including those of the breast. In the latter, both behave as potent inhibitors of invasion. Nevertheless, the signaling pathways whereby the activated GnRH/GnRHR system exerts this effect have not been clearly established. In this study, we provide experimental evidence that describes components of the mechanism(s) whereby GnRH inhibits breast cancer cell invasion.\\n\\nMETHODS: Actin polymerization and substrate adhesion was measured in the highly invasive cell line, MDA-MB-231 transiently expressing the wild-type or mutant DesK191 GnRHR by fluorometry, flow cytometric analysis, and confocal microscopy, in the absence or presence of GnRH agonist. The effect of RhoA-GTP on stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly was measured in MDA-MB-231 cells co-expressing the GnRHRs and the GAP domain of human p190Rho GAP-A or the dominant negative mutant GAP-Y1284D. Cell invasion was determined by the transwell migration assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: Agonist-stimulated activation of the wild-type GnRHR and the highly plasma membrane expressed mutant GnRHR-DesK191 transiently transfected to MDA-MB-231 cells, favored F-actin polymerization and substrate adhesion. Confocal imaging allowed detection of an association between F-actin levels and the increase in stress fibers promoted by exposure to GnRH. Pull-down assays showed that the effects observed on actin cytoskeleton resulted from GnRH-stimulated activation of RhoA GTPase. Activation of this small G protein favored the marked increase in both cell adhesion to Collagen-I and number of focal adhesion complexes leading to inhibition of the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells as disclosed by assays in Transwell Chambers.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We here show that GnRH inhibits invasion of highly invasive breast cancer-derived MDA-MB-231 cells. This effect is mediated through an increase in substrate adhesion promoted by activation of RhoA GTPase and formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. These observations offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms whereby activation of overexpressed GnRHRs affects cell invasion potential of this malignant cell line, and provide opportunities for designing mechanism-based adjuvant therapies for breast cancer."

        "title": "[Experimental study on molecular mechanism of nm23-H1 gene transfection reversing the malignant phenotype of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line]",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: nm23-H1 gene is a well-known tumor metastasis suppression gene. Our previous study has found that transfection of wild type nm23-H1 gene can significantly downregulate the ERK1/2 activity of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of nm23-H1 and exogenous ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126 on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981 and its malignant biological behaviors. METHODS: The expressive levels of total-ERK1/2, dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 relative activity of the human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell lines, L9981 (parent cell line with nm23-H1 gene hetero-deletion), L9981-nm23-H1 (transfected with nm23-H1 gene ) and L9981-PLXSN (transfected with vector) were detected by Western blot and immunoprecipitation technique after treating with U0126 (40mumol/L for 20 minutes). The in vitro proliferative and invasive abilities among the above three lung cancer cell lines were determined by MTT and improved Boyden chamber methods. RESULTS: The phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression level and relative activity in L9981-nm23-H1 lung cancer cell line were remarkably lower than those in L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines after being treated with U0126 (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines. No significant difference of total ERK1/2 expression level was observed among the three lung cancer cell lines (P > 0.05) after being treated with U0126. The in vitro proliferation and invasion of L9981-nm-23H1 lung cancer cell line were remarkably lower than those of L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines (P < 0.01 ), but no significant difference was found between L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines (P > 0.05 ); U0126 could significantly down-regulate the in vitro proliferation and invasion of L9981 lung cancer cell line (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the activity of ERK1/2 in L9981 lung cancer cell line and transfecting the nm23-H1 gene into the L9981 lung cancer cell line may produce similar cell biological behavior changes, namely the significant reduction of in vitro proliferation and invasion of L9981 lung cancer cell line. These results indicate that the molecular mechanism which nm23-H1 gene reverses invasion and proliferation of the human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line may be related to its effects of down-regulating the activity of the key kinase ERK1/2 of Ras-to-MAPK signal transduction pathway."

Here, we show that JARID1B, encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase, is frequently amplified and overexpressed in luminal breast tumors and a somatic mutation in a basal-like breast cancer results in the gain of unique chromatin binding and luminal expression and splicing patterns. Downregulation of JARID1B in luminal cells induces basal genes expression and growth arrest, which is rescued by TGF?? pathway inhibitors. Integrated JARID1B chromatin binding, H3K4 methylation, and expression profiles suggest a key function for JARID1B in luminal cell-specific expression programs. High luminal JARID1B activity is associated with poor outcome in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast tumors. ???Somatic genetic alterations of JARID1B in breast cancer???Importance of JARID1B for luminal gene expression programs???Missense mutation in JARID1B leads to gain of luminal genes expression???High luminal JARID1B activity is associated with poor outcome in ER+ tumors.

We identified thousands of AR binding sites in CRPC tissue, most of which were not identified in PC cell lines. Many adjacent genes showed AR regulation in xenografts but not in cultured LNCaPs, demonstrating an in-vivo-restricted set of AR-regulated genes. Functional studies support a model of altered signaling in vivo that directs AR binding. We identified a 16 gene signature that outperformed a larger in-vitro-derived signature in clinical data sets, showing the importance of persistent AR signaling in CRPC. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: In a phase I/II trial, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received preoperative radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gefitinib. Results were promising. To elucidate the molecular and biological effects, we replicated the schedule in the LoVo human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. METHODS: RT (2 Gy daily for 3 days), 5-FU (0.3, 0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 muM) and gefitinib (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 muM) were administered alone, in double combinations and all together. We assessed viable cells, cell cycle, cyclin, p53 and p21 expression, signalling pathways by means of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), p-AKT and p-ERK 1-2 and clonogenic capacity. RESULTS: RT and 5-FU were cytotoxic. Gefitinib was cytostatic. RT reduced clonogenic capacity more than 5-FU. 5-FU induced more cell death than RT, but surviving cells were proliferative (cyclins and p-EGFR increased). 5-FU + RT had a synergistic effect. Gefitinib, enhancing G1 accumulation, reduced proliferation of cells surviving 5-FU and 5-FU + RT. It slightly increased the cytotoxicity of RT and 5-FU. CONCLUSIONS: As gefitinib limited the proliferation rate of cells surviving 5-FU and 5-FU + RT in the LoVo cell line, it may be a useful addition to chemotherapy and RT in rectal cancer patients."

However, the poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism limited their medical application. In this study, we encapsulated curcumin with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), 5-Fu with Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) separately and tested its properties and anticancer potentials. SLN-curcumin and LDH-5-Fu were determined to be 100 and 60\u2009nm by Transmission Electron Microscopy detection, and the loading efficiency were 28%\u00b12.5% and 16.7%\u00b11.8%, individually. Furthermore, SLN-curcumin and LDH-5-Fu showed a significantly synergetic effect on SMMC-7721 cell stronger than plain drugs together, of which the Idrug loaded nano-carriers was only 0.315. FACS analysis revealed that the combination of SLN-curcumin and LDH-5-Fu induced 80.1% apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells, which were 1.7-folds of the sum of the two plain drug loaded carriers. The results demonstrated the significant synergetic anticancer potentials of nano-encapsulated curcumin and 5-Fu, which could be further explored for the treatment of other carcinoma."

        "abstract": "Cancer patients often suffer from local tumor recurrence after radiation therapy. Cell cycling, an intricate sequence of events which guarantees high genomic fidelity, has been suggested to affect DNA damage responses and eventual radioresistant characteristics of cancer cells. Here, we established a radioresistant lung cancer cell line, A549R , by exposing the parental A549 cells to repeated \u03b3-ray irradiation with a total dose of 60 Gy. The radiosensitivity of A549 and A549R was confirmed using colony formation assays. We then focused on examination of the cell cycle distribution between A549 and A549R and found that the proportion of cells in the radioresistant S phase increased, whereas that in the radiosensitive G1 phase decreased. When A549 and A549R cells were exposed to 4 Gy irradiation the total differences in cell cycle redistribution suggested that G2-M cell cycle arrest plays a predominant role in mediating radioresistance. In order to further explore the possible mechanisms behind the cell cycle related radioresistance, we examined the expression of Cdc25 proteins which orchestrate cell cycle transitions. The results showed that expression of Cdc25c increased accompanied by the decrease of Cdc25a and we proposed that the quantity of Cdc25c, rather than activated Cdc25c or Cdc25a, determines the radioresistance of cells."

Mechanistically, fumarate binds to and activates a reactive oxygen species scavenging enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1.

Using the last release of the UMD_p53 database (2007) (http://p53.free.fr), we analysed the p53 status of 1,211 cell lines published between 1989 and 2007. p53 mutations in cell lines from various types of cancers display a striking similarity in the distribution of mutations and in the pattern of mutational events compared to tumors, indicating that they are representative of the cells from which they were derived. Analysis of the residual transcriptional activity of p53 mutants identified in cell lines that displayed two different p53 mutations show that there is a high frequency of weak mutations that are paired with more potent mutations suggesting a driver/passenger configuration. Strikingly, we found discrepancies in the p53 status for 23% (88/384) of cell lines, for which the p53 status was established independently in two laboratories. Using the NCI-60 cell line panel as a model widely used in the literature, the p53 status could not be ascertained for 13 cell lines due to a lack of homogeneous data in the literature. Our study clearly confirms that misidentified cell lines are still a silent and neglected danger and that extreme care should be taken as a wrong p53 status could lead to disastrous experimental interpretations. The p53 web site has been updated with new sections describing the p53 status in the majority of cell lines and a special section devoted to cell lines with controversial p53 status."

EGFR overexpression has been associated with more aggressive disease, poor prognosis, low survival rate and low response to therapy. ErbB1 amplification and mutation are associated with tumor development and are implicated in ineffective treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the ErbB1 copy number affects EGFR expression, cell proliferation or cell migration by comparing two different cell lines.\\n\\nMETHODS: The copies of ErbB1 gene was evaluated by FISH. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting were performed to determine location and expression of proteins mentioned in the present study. Proliferation was studied by flow cytometry and cell migration by wound healing assay and time lapse.\\n\\nRESULTS: We investigated the activation and function of EGFR in the A549 and HK2 lung cancer cell lines, which contain 3 and 6 copies of ErbB1, respectively. The expression of EGFR was lower in the HK2 cell line. EGFR was activated after stimulation with EGF in both cell lines, but this activation did not promote differences in cellular proliferation when compared to control cells. Inhibiting EGFR with AG1478 did not modify cellular proliferation, confirming previous data. However, we observed morphological alterations, changes in microfilament organization and increased cell migration upon EGF stimulation. However, these effects did not seem to be consequence of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: EGFR expression did not appear to be associated to the ErbB1 gene copy number, and neither of these aspects appeared to affect cell proliferation. However, EGFR activation by EGF resulted in cell migration stimulation in both cell lines."

        "abstract": "To investigate the antitumor activity and action mechanism of fengycin using the human lung cancer cell line 95D. The antitumor activity of fengycin was tested in vitro and in vivo. Reactive oxygen species production, Ca(2+) uptake, and mitochondrial membrane potential loss induced by fengycin in 95D cells were measured by flow cytometry and a laser confocal microscope. Lactate dehydrogenase release and caspase activity in fengycin-treated 95D cells were assayed using cytotoxicity detection kits. Apoptosis triggered by fengycin was identified by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and flow cytometry. The effects of fengycin on cell-cycle and apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and western blot. Treatment with fengycin not only significantly decreased cell proliferation in various cancer cell lines including 95D but inhibited the growth of xenografted 95D cells in nude mice. Fengycin also induced reactive oxygen species production and Ca(2+) uptake, as well as lactate dehydrogenase release and mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Further experiments showed that fengycin could trigger apoptosis in 95D cells and cause cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 stage by downregulating cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). While investigating caspase activity and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, fengycin was found to induce apoptosis in 95D cells through the mitochondrial pathway, evidenced by increased caspase activity, Bax expression, and cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, as well as decreased Bcl-2 levels. Fengycin can inhibit the growth of the cancer cell line 95D by regulating the cell cycle and promoting apoptosis, suggesting that it may have potential as an anticancer treatment."

We report that VCAM-1 provides a survival advantage to breast cancer cells that infiltrate leukocyte-rich microenvironments such as the lungs. VCAM-1 tethers metastasis-associated macrophages to cancer cells via counter-receptor \u03b14-integrins. Clustering of cell surface VCAM-1, acting through Ezrin, triggers Akt activation and protects cancer cells from proapoptotic cytokines such as TRAIL. This prosurvival function of VCAM-1 can be blocked by antibodies against \u03b14-integrins. Thus, newly disseminated cancer cells expressing VCAM-1 can thrive in leukocyte-rich microenvironments through juxtacrine activation of a VCAM-1-Ezrin-PI3K/Akt survival pathway. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "The involvement of mutated androgen receptors (mut-AR) in the actions of estrogens in prostate cancer cells is controversial. This work was designed to determine the role of such receptors in the growth inhibition by estradiol (E2) and androgens of the MOP cell line, a derivative of the LNCaP cell line. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was used as a \"tool\". E2 like DHT and R1881 inhibits MOP cell proliferation while DES does not. E2 and R1881 down regulate mut-AR mRNA, DES does not. E2 enhances mut-AR transcriptional activity less efficiently than R1881 while DES does not. E2 and R1881 up regulate PSA secretion in a dose-dependent manner, DES does it marginally at 10(-6)M. MOP cells express low amounts of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA but neither DES nor E2 and R1881 do enhance ER transcriptional activity. DES and E2 bind to mut-AR with relative binding affinities which are respectively 1/175 and 1/10 that of DHT. The E2 and androgen-repressed proliferation is prevented by DES and by the anti-androgen bicalutamide. In LNCaP cells, DES prevents the androgen-enhanced proliferation. These results strongly suggest that: (a) the putative endogenous ERs are biologically inactive in MOP cells, (b) the E2-repressed proliferation results from hormone binding to mut-AR and, (c) DES is an anti-androgen in mut-AR expressing cell line."

We identified a small-molecule Bcl2-BH4 domain antagonist, BDA-366, that binds BH4 with high affinity and selectivity. BDA-366-Bcl2 binding induces conformational change in Bcl2 that abrogates its antiapoptotic function, converting it from a survival molecule to a cell death inducer. BDA-366 suppresses growth of lung cancer xenografts derived from cell lines and patient without significant normal tissue toxicity at effective doses. mTOR inhibition upregulates Bcl2 in lung cancer cells and tumor tissues from clinical trial patients. Combined BDA-366 and RAD001 treatment exhibits strong synergy against lung cancer invivo. Development of this Bcl2-BH4 antagonist may provide a strategy to improve lung cancer outcome."

We show that GRP78 binding peptide motifs target tumor cells specifically in vivo and in human cancer specimens ex vivo. Moreover, synthetic chimeric peptides composed of GRP78 binding motifs fused to a programmed cell death-inducing sequence can suppress tumor growth in xenograft and isogenic mouse models of prostate and breast cancer.

Gene expression profiling chips was used to screen differentially expressed genes between experiment group and control group. Reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting were used to determine mRNA and protein levels. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nWith increasing PPI concentration, the metastatic capacity of cells decreased, with significance differences between the experimental and control groups (P<0.01) as well as between two concentration groups. Gene expression profiling identified 123 differentially expressed genes, of which 70 were downregulated and 53 were upregulated. The genes were involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, including apoptosis, proliferation and metastasis. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) showed that differential genes PIK3C2B, Caspase 9 and Wnt5A were downregulated with increasing PPI, showing an evident dose-effect relationship. The c-Jun was an exception. As the PPI dosage increased and the exposure time was extended, c-Jun relative expression showed an upward trend. There were significant differences between the experiment and control (P<0.05). Western blot analyses showed that PPI treatment decreased levels of Caspase 9, Wnt5A and PIK3C2B and increased activated Caspase 9, c-Jun and p-c-Jun expression levels. \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nPPI has strong antitumor and anti transfer activity. It can activate c-Jun expression and the JNK signaling pathway, elicit cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial-mediated Caspase activation pathway, and finally inhibit tumor growth and migration in vitro. The downregulation of PIK3C2B and Wnt5A jointly inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of HO-8910PM. PPI may be a novel treatment for ovarian cancer."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer cells are usually sensitive to several chemotherapeutic regimens, but they can develop chemoresistance after prolonged exposure to cytotoxic drugs, acquiring a more aggressive phenotype. Drug resistance might involve the multi-drug resistance (MDR) 1 gene, encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein p-170 (P-gp), which antagonizes intracellular accumulation of cytotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin. We previously demonstrated that type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors can reverse the chemoresistance phenotype of a medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line by inhibiting P-gp expression and function. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of COX-2 inhibitors in modulating chemoresistance in a human breast cancer cell line, MCF7. MCF7 cells, expressing COX-2 but not MDR1, were treated with increasing doses of doxorubicin, and they became chemoresistant after 10 days of treatment, in association with MDR1 expression induction. This effect was reversed by doxorubicin withdrawal and prevented by co-incubation with N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (NS-398), a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Treatment with NS-398 alone did not influence cell viability of a resistant MCF7 cell clone (rMCF7), but sensitized rMCF7 cells to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. Moreover, treatment with NS-398 significantly reduced MDR1 expression in rMCF7 cells. Doxorubicin-induced membrane P-gp expression and function was also greatly impaired. Our data therefore support the hypothesis that COX-2 inhibitors can prevent or reduce the development of the chemoresistance phenotype in breast cancer cells by inhibiting P-gp expression and function."

        "abstract": "A relatively novel paradigm in tumor biology hypothesizes that cancer growth is driven by tumor cells with stem-like properties. However, direct proof of a population of stem cells in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains elusive. In this study, we enriched for stem-like cells from the SCLC cell line H446 by growing them as spheres in a defined serum-free medium. Sphere-derived cells have increased in vitro clonogenic and in vivo tumorigenic potentials as well as drug-resistant properties. After enrichment for stem-like cells, we used multiple candidate stem cell markers to examine the expression profile and found that the sphere-derived cells contained a higher proportion of cells expressing the stem cell surface markers uPAR and CD133 when compared with parental cells. To identify a selectable marker for the sphere-forming cells, we evaluated the sphere-forming abilities of uPAR \n                        + and uPAR \n                        - cells as well as the sphere-forming abilities of CD133 \n                        + and CD133 \n                        - cells. Both CD133 \n                        + and CD133 \n                        - cell fractions were capable of forming spheres, and no statistically significant difference was observed in the sphere-forming efficiency between these two populations. In contrast, cells derived from the uPAR \n                        + fraction were capable of forming spheres, whereas cells derived from the uPAR \n                        - fraction remained as single cells. Moreover, uPAR \n                        + cells efficiently formed transplantable tumors, whereas uPAR \n                        - cells were unable to initiate tumors when transplanted at equivalent cell numbers. In addition, uPAR \n                        + cells could differentiate into CD56 \n                        +cells, CK \n                        + cells, and uPAR \n                        - cells. These data support the existence of a population of tumor sphere-forming cells with stem cell properties in the H446 SCLC cell line. Furthermore, the stem cell population may be enriched in cells expressing the uPAR cell surface marker. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Activating \u03b2-catenin somatic mutations are found in ACC and have been associated with a poor clinical outcome. In fact, activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway seems to play a major role in ACC aggressiveness, and might, thus, represent a promising therapeutic target.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: Similar to patient tumor specimen the H295 cell line derived from an ACC harbors a natural activating \u03b2-catenin mutation. We herein assess the in vitro and in vivo effect of \u03b2-catenin inactivation using a doxycyclin (dox) inducible shRNA plasmid in H295R adrenocortical cancer cells line (clone named sh\u03b2).\\n\\nRESULTS: Following dox treatment a profound reduction in \u03b2-catenin expression was detectable in sh\u03b2 clones in comparison to control clones (Ctr). Accordingly, we observed a decrease in Wnt/\u03b2catenin-dependent luciferase reporter activity as well as a decreased expression of AXIN2 representing an endogenous \u03b2-catenin target gene. Concomitantly, \u03b2-catenin silencing resulted in a decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle alterations with cell accumulation in the G1 phase and increased apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, on established tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice, 9 days of \u03b2-catenin silencing resulted in a significant reduction of CTNNB1 and AXIN2 expression. Moreover, continous \u03b2-catenin silencing, starting 3 days after tumor cell inoculation, was associated with a complete absence of tumor growth in the sh\u03b2 group while tumors were present in all animals of the control group.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In summary, these experiments provide evidences that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibition in ACC is a promising therapeutic target."

        "abstract": "To determine sequence variations of the BUB1 and BUB1B genes in pancreatic cancer, the entire coding regions of the BUB1 and BUB1B genes were sequenced in pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts. Although only polymorphic alterations were found in the BUB1B gene, the aneuploid pancreatic cell line Hs766T had two novel missense variants (p.[Y259C;H265N]) in the BUB1 gene. These mutations were on the same allele, accompanied by a wild-type BUB1 allele. This change was not found in other samples, the literature, or 110 additional chromosomes from a reference population. Compared to two cell lines having microsatellite instability (MIN), the TP53 wild-type pancreatic cell line Hs766T had a defective mitotic spindle checkpoint, indicative of a cell line with chromosomal instability (CIN). Evidence that this checkpoint pathway can be abrogated by mutations in the BUB1 gene (Cahill et al., 1998) supports the suggestion the missense mutations of the BUB1 gene in the Hs766T cell line may contribute to its observed mitotic checkpoint defect."

        "abstract": "Telomere dysfunction and associated fusion-breakage in the mouse encourages epithelial carcinogenesis and a more humanized genomic profile that includes nonreciprocal translocations (NRTs). Here, array comparative genomic hybridization was used to determine the pathogenic significance of NRTs and to determine whether telomere dysfunction also drives amplifications and deletions of cancer-relevant loci. Compared to tumors arising in mice with intact telomeres, tumors with telomere dysfunction possessed higher levels of genomic instability and showed numerous amplifications and deletions in regions syntenic to human cancer hotspots. These observations suggest that telomere-based crisis provides a mechanism of chromosomal instability, including regional amplifications and deletions, that drives carcinogenesis.

HSP70 expression is induced following treatment with HSP90 inhibitors, which may attenuate the cell death effects of this class of inhibitor. Here we show that silencing either heat-shock cognate 70 (HSC70) or HSP72 expression in human cancer cell lines has no effect on HSP90 activity or cell proliferation. However, simultaneously reducing the expression of both of these isoforms induces proteasome-dependent degradation of HSP90 client proteins, G1 cell-cycle arrest, and extensive tumor-specific apoptosis. Importantly, simultaneous silencing of HSP70 isoforms in nontumorigenic cell lines does not result in comparable growth arrest or induction of apoptosis, indicating a potential therapeutic window. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "The HCT-15 human colon cancer cell line has a Na(+)-dependent carrier-mediated transport system for the uptake of glycerol. A similar transport system has been suggested to be present also in the small intestine and is of interest with regard to its role in the absorption of glycerol and possibly some structurally related compounds. To help clarifying functional characteristics of such glycerol transport systems, we examined the effect of butyrate, an agent known to facilitate the differentiation of cells, on glycerol uptake in HCT-15 cells. The uptake of glycerol (0.4 microM) was found to be about 5-fold greater in HCT-15 cells pretreated with butyrate (2 mM) for 24 h than in those untreated. The increase in the uptake by the butyrate treatment was due to an increase in the maximum transport rate. The effect of butyrate was almost completely suppressed when actinomycin D, an inhibitor of gene transcription, and cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, were added to the medium during the butyrate treatment. These results support the suggestion that a specific carrier protein is involved in glycerol uptake by HCT-15 cells and the carrier protein is one of those inducible by butyrate-induced cell differentiation"

        "abstract": "Multiplexed quantitation via isobaric chemical tags (e.g., tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)) has the potential to revolutionize quantitative proteomics. However, until recently the utility of these tags was questionable due to reporter ion ratio distortion resulting from fragmentation of coisolated interfering species. These interfering signals can be negated through additional gas-phase manipulations (e.g., MS/MS/MS (MS3) and proton-transfer reactions (PTR)). These methods, however, have a significant sensitivity penalty. Using isolation waveforms with multiple frequency notches (i.e., synchronous precursor selection, SPS), we coisolated and cofragmented multiple MS2 fragment ions, thereby increasing the number of reporter ions in the MS3 spectrum 10-fold over the standard MS3 method (i.e., MultiNotch MS3). By increasing the reporter ion signals, this method improves the dynamic range of reporter ion quantitation, reduces reporter ion signal variance, and ultimately produces more high-quality quantitative measurements. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed biological triplicates of eight colon cancer cell lines using the MultiNotch MS3 method. Across all the replicates we quantified 8 378 proteins in union and 6 168 proteins in common. Taking into account that each of these quantified proteins contains eight distinct cell-line measurements, this data set encompasses 174 704 quantitative ratios each measured in triplicate across the biological replicates. Herein, we demonstrate that the MultiNotch MS3 method uniquely combines multiplexing capacity with quantitative sensitivity and accuracy, drastically increasing the informational value obtainable from proteomic experiments."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of apigenin in the human bladder cancer cell line T24 for the first time. Methods: T24 cells were treated with varying concentrations and time of apigenin. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell motility and invasiveness were assayed by Matrigel migration and invasion assay. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis were used to detect cell apoptosis, cell cycle and signaling pathway. Results: The results demonstrated that apigenin suppressed proliferation and inhibited the migration and invasion potential of T24 bladder cancer cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner, which was associated with induced G2/M Phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The mechanism of action is like to involve PI3K/Akt pathway and Bcl-2 family proteins. Apigenin increased caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage, indicating that apigenin induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent way. Conclusions: These findings suggest that apigenin may be an effective way for treating human bladder cancer."

We show that the Snail-G9a-Dnmt1 complex, which is critical for E-cadherin promoter silencing, is also required for the promoter methylation of fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (FBP1) in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Loss of FBP1 induces glycolysis and results in increased glucose uptake, macromolecule biosynthesis, formation of tetrameric PKM2, and maintenance of ATP production under hypoxia. Loss of FBP1 also inhibits oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species production by suppressing mitochondrial complex I activity; this metabolic reprogramming results in an increased CSC-like property and tumorigenicity by enhancing the interaction of ??-catenin with T-cell factor. Our study indicates that the loss of FBP1 is a critical oncogenic event in EMT and BLBC. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

These cells were found to depend on a neuregulin-1 (NRG1)-mediated autocrine loop driving HER3 activation, which can be disrupted by lapatinib. Elevated NRG1 expression and activated HER3 are strongly associated with lapatinib sensitivity in vitro, and these biomarkers were enriched in a subset of primary head and neck cancer samples.

        "abstract": "The frequent loss of heterozygosity of chromosome (Chr) 17 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), particularly high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas (HGOSCs), has been attributed to the disruption of known tumour suppressor genes, such as TP53 (17p13), as well as other genes on this chromosome that alone or in combination have a role in EOC. In a transcriptome analysis of Chr17 genes, we observed significant underexpression of the chemokine CCL2 (17q12) in a small set of HGOSC samples relative to normal ovarian surface epithelial cells and a significant upregulation of CCL2 in the TP53-mutated OV-90 EOC cell line rendered non-tumourigenic as a consequence of genetic manipulation. Here, we report that overexpressing CCL2 in OV-90 resulted in latency of tumour formation at intraperitoneal (i.p.) but not subcutaneous sites in a mouse xenograft model. Overexpressing CCL2 affected cell morphology and exerted modest, but not significant effects on cell viability, colony formation and cell migration. We report significant underexpression of CCL2 by transcriptome analysis (P=0.015) and by immunohistochemistry in 77% of HGOSC samples (n=65). Absent or a very low level of protein expression by immunohistochemistry was also observed in 71% of additional HGOSC samples (n=122). However, CCL2 protein expression did not significantly correlate with overall or disease-free survival. The epithelial cells of normal fallopian tubes, a purported origin of HGOSC, exhibited expression of CCL2 protein by immunohistochemistry. Our results affirm that CCL2 underexpression is a significant feature of HGOSC samples, and that CCL2 overexpression in an EOC cell line model affects tumourigenic potential in the i.p. setting."

Tankyrase 1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates TRF1 and releases it from telomeres, allowing access of telomerase to telomeres. Here we demonstrate that tankyrase 1 inhibition in human cancer cells enhances telomere shortening by a telomerase inhibitor and hastens cell death. Conversely, either tankyrase 1 upregulation or telomere shortening, each of which decreased TRF1 loading on a chromosome end, attenuated the impact of telomerase inhibition. These results are consistent with the idea that telomeres having fewer TRF1s increase the efficiency of their elongation by telomerase. This study implies that both enzyme activity and accessibility to telomeres can be targets for telomerase inhibition."

Loss of the ability to concentrate iodide makes thyroid cancer cells refractory to radioiodine therapy. Therefore, the methods that enhance the uptake of radioiodine may have significant therapeutic effect. Electroporation involves the application of short high-voltage electric pulses which transiently permeabilize the plasma membrane, allowing entry of the otherwise impermeable molecules. The aim of our study was to use electroporation for incorporating radioiodine into a non-iodine concentrating thyroid cell line. Cultured WRO thyroid cancer cells that do not incorporate iodine due to the lack of the specific transporter protein incorporated significant amounts of radioiodine after electroporation. The uptake of radioiodine by electroporation showed dependence on the electric field, external concentration of the iodine, time and the temperature of incubation. The incorporated radioiodine was retained over a period of 24h. The retainability of the incorporated iodine may have a significant effect on the tumoricidal properties if validated in vivo. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

A similar correlation between low p53 levels and Aurora-A gene deletions and expression is found in human breast cancer cell lines. In vitro studies using mouse embryo fibroblasts demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora-A can have either positive or negative effects on cell growth as a function of p53 status.

        "abstract": "The low dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) in human lung cancer cell line A549 was investigated, the changes of ATM kinase, cell cycle and apoptosis of cells at different doses of radiation were observed, and the possible mechanisms were discussed. A549 cells in logarithmic growth phase were irradiated with (60)Co gamma-rays at doses of 0-2 Gy. Together with flow cytometry for precise cell sorting, cell survival fraction was measured by means of conventional colony-formation assay. The expression of ATM1981Ser-P protein was examined by Western blot 1 h after radiation. Apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining, and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining flow cytometry 24 h after radiation. Cell cycle distribution was observed by flow cytometry 6, 12 and 24 h after radiation. The results showed that the expression of ATM1981Ser-P protein was observed at 0.2 Gy, followed by an increase at >0.2 Gy, and reached the peak at 0.5 Gy, with little further increase as the dose exceeded 0.5 Gy. Twenty-four h after radiation, partial cells presented the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis, and the cell apoptosis curve was coincident with the survival curve. As compared with control group, the cell cycle almost had no changes after exposure to 0.1 and 0.2 Gy radiation (P>0.05). After exposure to 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 Gy radiation, G(2)/M phase arrest occurred 6 and 12 h after radiation (P<0.05), and the ratio of G(2)/M phase cells was decreased 24 h after radiation (P<0.05). It was concluded that A549 cells displayed the phenomenon of HRS/IRR. The mode of cell death was mainly apoptosis. The activity of ATM and cell cycle change may take an important role in HRS/IRR."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Astragalus injection (AI) on basal-like breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and murine bone marrow stromal stem cells (mMSCs). METHODS: MDA-MB-468 cells and primary cultured mMSCs were treated by different concentrations of AI, and with untreated MDA-MB-468 cells as blank control. The morphology of cells was observed by phase-contrast inverted microscope and transmission electron microscopy. Cytotoxic effects of AI on MDA-MB-468 cells and mMSCs were evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells induced by AI were measured by flow cytometry. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in supernatants was measured by enzymatic colorimetric method. The expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53 protein in MDA-MB-468 cells were evaluated by streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. RESULTS: A time-dependent cytotoxic effect of 1 g/ml AI was observed in MDA-MB-468 cells. 1 g/ml AI also had cytotoxic effect on mMSCs, but its effect was not better than cisplatin. 0.1 g/ml AI could promote the proliferation of mMSCs. Different concentrations of AI could all induce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells. There was no significant difference in LDH activity in the supernatants between blank control group and AI-treated and cisplatin-treated groups. AI could down-regulate the expressions of EGFR and p53 protein. CONCLUSION: The effects of AI on MDA-MB-468 cells and mMSCs are related to the concentration of AI, and its mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells may be due to down-regulation of the expressions of EGFR and p53 protein."

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that some cancers are hierarchically organized, sustained by a relatively rare population of cancer-initiating cells (C-ICs). Although the capacity to initiate tumors upon serial transplantation is a hallmark of all C-ICs, little is known about the genes that control this process. Here, we establish that ID1 and ID3 function together to govern colon cancer-initiating cell (CC-IC) self-renewal through cell-cycle restriction driven by the cell-cycle inhibitor p21. Regulation of p21 by ID1 and ID3 is a central mechanism preventing the accumulation of excess DNA damage and subsequent functional exhaustion of CC-ICs. Additionally, silencing of ID1 and ID3 increases sensitivity of CC-ICs to the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, linking tumor initiation function with chemotherapy resistance. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc."

We found that Cdk5 and its cofactors p35 and p25 are highly expressed in human MTC and that Cdk5 activity promotes MTC proliferation. A conditional MTC mouse model was generated and corroborated the role of aberrant Cdk5 activation in MTC. C cell-specific overexpression of p25 caused rapid C cell hyperplasia leading to lethal MTC, which was arrested by repressing p25 overexpression. A comparative phosphoproteomic screen between proliferating and arrested MTC identified the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) as a crucial Cdk5 downstream target. Prevention of Rb phosphorylation at Ser807/Ser811 attenuated MTC proliferation. These findings implicate Cdk5 signaling via Rb as critical to MTC tumorigenesis and progression. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Tumor hypoxia is an obstacle to radiotherapy.

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway is a widely recognized survival signal that confers radioresistance.

Here, we demonstrate that IGF-II stimulation decreases clonogenic survival under hypoxic conditions in the pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1 and Panc-1, and in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. IGF treatment under hypoxic conditions suppressed increased radiation sensitivity in these cell lines by pharmacologically inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, a major IGF signal-transduction pathway. Meanwhile, IGF-II induced the endoplasmic reticulum stress response under hypoxia, including increased protein levels of CHOP and ATF4, mRNA levels of CHOP, GADD34, and BiP, as well as splicing levels of XBP-1. The response was suppressed by inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Overexpression of CHOP in AsPC-1 cells increased radiation sensitivity by IGF-II simulation under hypoxic conditions, whereas suppression of CHOP expression levels with small hairpin RNA or a dominant negative form of a proline-rich extensin-like receptor protein kinase in hypoxia decreased IGF-induced radiosensitivity. IGF-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress contributed to radiosensitization independent of cell cycle status.

Here, we report a function of TGIF in Wnt signaling. TGIF associates with and diverts Axin1 and Axin2 from the ??-catenin destruction complex, therefore allowing ??-catenin accrual. Intriguingly, activation of Wnt signaling induces the expression of TGIF, which unveils a feed-forward loop that ensures effective integration of Wnt signaling. In triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), elevated levels of TGIF correlate with high Wnt signaling and poor survival of patients. Moreover, genetic experiments revealed that Tgif1 ablation impeded mammary tumor development in MMTV-Wnt1 mice, further underscoring a requirement of TGIF for oncogenic Wnt signaling."

The MDM2 SNP309T > G promoter polymorphism enhances Sp1 binding and has been linked to cancer risk and young age at diagnosis although with conflicting evidence. We report a second MDM2 promoter polymorphism, SNP285G > C, residing on the SNP309G allele. SNP285C occurs in Caucasians only, where 7.7% (95% CI 7.6%-7.8%) of healthy individuals carry the SNP285C/309G haplotype. In vitro analyses reveals that SNP309G enhances but SNP285C strongly reduces Sp1 promoter binding. Comparing MDM2 promoter status among different cohorts of ovarian (n = 1993) and breast (n = 1973) cancer patients versus healthy controls (n = 3646), SNP285C reduced the risk of both ovarian (OR 0.74; CI 0.58-0.94) and breast cancer (OR 0.79; CI 0.62-1.00) among SNP309G carriers. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Curcumin (Diferuloylmethane) is a major chemical component of turmeric (curcuma longa) and is used as a spice to give a specific flavor and yellow color in Asian food. Curcumin exhibits growth inhibitory effects in a broad range of tumors as well as in TPA-induced skin tumors in mice. This study was undertaken to investigate the radiosensitizing effects of curcumin in p53 mutant prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Compared to cells that were irradiated alone (SF(2)=0.635; D(0)=231 cGy), curcumin at 2 and 4 microM concentrations in combination with radiation showed significant enhancement to radiation-induced clonogenic inhibition (SF(2)=0.224: D(0)=97 cGy and SF(2)=0.080: D(0)=38 cGy) and apoptosis. It has been reported that curcumin inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NFkappaB activity that is essential for Bcl-2 protein induction. In PC-3 cells, radiation upregulated TNF-alpha protein leading to an increase in NFkappaB activity resulting in the induction of Bcl-2 protein. However, curcumin in combination with radiation treated showed inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated NFkappaB activity resulting in bcl-2 protein downregulation. Bax protein levels remained constant in these cells after radiation or curcumin plus radiation treatments. However, the downregulation of Bcl-2 and no changes in Bax protein levels in curcumin plus radiation-treated PC-3 cells, together, altered the Bcl2 : Bax ratio and this caused the enhanced radiosensitization effect. In addition, significant activation of cytochrome c and caspase-9 and -3 were observed in curcumin plus radiation treatments. Together, these mechanisms strongly suggest that the natural compound curcumin is a potent radiosesitizer, and it acts by overcoming the effects of radiation-induced prosurvival gene expression in prostate cancer."

Materials and methods: According to the district in the tumor following cryoablation, the CWR-22RV prostate cancer cells were divided into four groups to construct the freezing model of prostate cancer in cell level: Group A, control cells (the uncovered district), Group B, freezing cells (sub-lethal district away from necrosis), Group C, control cells cultured with 1640 and necrosis supernatant and Group D, freezing cells cultured with 1640 and necrosis supernatant (sub-lethal district close to necrosis). Cell apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry analysis 24. h later. Then supernatant in four groups was extracted to test the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 by ELISA at the time points of 5, 10, 20, 36, and 48. h. At the same time, intracellular TGF-\u03b2, Smad2/3, Smad4 of four groups were detected by Western blot at the time point of 10. h. Results: In aspect of apoptosis, groups B-D have higher apoptosis rate than group A, group D has more apoptosis cells than group B and C. This was verified that the model was successful. Moreover, we found that group C has higher delayed apoptosis rate than group A, and group D has higher early apoptosis rate than other groups (. P<. 0.05); compared with group A, C, D, group B has less TGF-\u03b2 (. P<. 0.05). Group C secrets more TGF-\u03b2 than that in group A (. P<. 0.05) and group D secrets more TGF-\u03b2 than that in group C at the time points of 20, 36, 48. h (. P<. 0.05); Group C and D expressed more Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 than group A and B at the time point of 10. h after treatment. Meanwhile, cells in group D expressed more Smads than group C. Conclusion: Cryoablation could promote TGF-\u03b2 and its pathway, and the more close to the center of the ice ball, this effect is more apparent."

Based on these data, we determined that extensive gene expression changes occur in all cell types during cancer progression and that a significant fraction of altered genes encode secreted proteins and receptors. Despite the dramatic gene expression changes in all cell types, genetic alterations were detected only in cancer epithelial cells. The CXCL14 and CXCL12 chemokines overexpressed in tumor myoepithelial cells and myofibroblasts, respectively, bind to receptors on epithelial cells and enhance their proliferation, migration, and invasion. Thus, chemokines may play a role in breast tumorigenesis by acting as paracrine factors."

CDK4 inhibition is sufficient to cause arrest, but inhibition of CDK2 by p27 Kip1 redistribution or ectopic expression has no effect on proliferation. Likewise, inhibition of CDK2 through expression of dominant-negative (DN) CDK2 or antisense oligonucleotides did not prevent cell proliferation in these cells. We therefore tested whether CDK2 activity is dispensable in other cells. Surprisingly, osteosarcomas and Rb-negative cervical cancers continued to proliferate after depletion of CDK2 through antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering (si) RNA. Here we report of sustained cell proliferation in the absence of CDK2, and we suggest that CDK2 is not a suitable target for cancer therapy."

Tumor cells with low Par-4 expression survive therapy by evading a program of Par-4-dependent multinucleation and apoptosis that is otherwise engaged following treatment. Low Par-4 expression is associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and an increased risk of relapse in patients with breast cancer, and Par-4 is downregulated in residual tumor cells that survive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings identify Par-4-induced multinucleation as a mechanism of cell death in oncogene-addicted cells and establish Par-4 as a negative regulator of breast cancer recurrence. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc."

It is not clear whether there are any innate surveillants that are able to ensure that keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation, preventing the disease. IKK?? induces keratinocyte terminal differentiation, and its downregulation promotes skin tumor development. However, its intrinsic function in skin cancer is unknown. Here, we found that mice with IKK?? deletion in keratinocytes develop a thickened epidermis and spontaneous squamous cell-like carcinomas. Inactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or reintroduction of IKK?? inhibits excessive mitosis, induces terminal differentiation, and prevents skin cancer through repressing an EGFR-driven autocrine loop. Thus, IKK?? serves as an innate surveillant. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We found that many drug-treated \"oncogene-addicted\" cancer cells engage a positive feedback loop leading to Stat3 activation, consequently promoting cell survival and limiting overall drug response. This was observed in cancer cells driven by diverse activated kinases, including EGFR, HER2, ALK, and MET, as well as mutant KRAS. Specifically, MEK inhibition led to autocrine activation of Stat3 via the FGF receptor and JAK kinases, and pharmacological inhibition of MEK together with JAK and FGFR enhanced tumor regression. These findings suggest that inhibition of a Stat3 feedback loop may augment the response to a broad spectrum of drugs that target pathways of oncogene addiction. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc."

By using cells with inducible EWS-WT1 to screen high-density microarrays, we identified BAIAP3 as a transcriptional target of the chimera. The BAIAP3 promoter is specifically bound in vivo by the (-KTS) isoform of EWS-WT1, consistent with its activation in reporter assays. BAIAP3 encodes a protein implicated in regulated exocytosis, which is colocalized with a secreted growth factor within cytoplasmic organelles. Ectopic expression of BAIAP3 in tumor cells dramatically enhances growth in low serum and colony formation in soft agar. BAIAP3 therefore encodes a transcriptional target of an oncogenic fusion protein that implicates the regulated exocytotic pathway in cancer cell proliferation. Copyright \u00a9 2002 Cell Press."

Although a great effort is made to understand the pharmaceutical mechanisms of garlic and its derivatives, there are many mysteries to be uncovered. Using proteomic means, herein we have systematically studied the responses of protein expression in BGC823 cells, a gastric cancer cell line, induced by diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a major component of garlic derivatives. A total of 41 unique proteins in BGC823 were detected with significant changes in their expression levels corresponding with DATS administration. Of these proteins, five typical ones, glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1), Annexin I, Galectin and S100A11, were further examined by Western blotting, resulting in coincident data with the proteomic evidence. Moreover quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments offered dynamic data of mRNA expression, indicating the responses of Annexin I and GST-pi expression within a short period after DATS treatment. Interestingly, approximately 50% of DATS-sensitive proteins (19/41) in BGC823 are tightly associated with apoptotic pathways. These proteomic results presented, therefore, provide additional support to the hypothesis that garlic is a strong inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells."

METHODS: HT-29 cells were cultured in the presence of AZT. Telomerase activity was measured by using the telomerase repeat amplification protocol. Telomere length was determined by Southern analysis. The colorimetric microtiter assay was performed to determine the cytotoxic effects of AZT, alone and in combination with 5-FU. RESULTS: The presence of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (AZT-TP) effectively inhibited telomerase extracted from HT-29 cells. HT-29 cells cultured with 125 microM of AZT underwent fewer total population doublings over 91 days. Southern analysis revealed that telomere attrition occurred within this period. Exposure to 125 microM of AZT resulted in slightly reduced viability (10%) of HT-29 cells. However, the presence of AZT increased 5-FU cytotoxicity, suggesting that the effects of these two drugs are synergistic. CONCLUSIONS: The data are consistent with telomerase inhibition having growth-inhibitory effects in addition to those predicted to accompany loss of telomere function. Further studies using specific small-molecule inhibitors will confirm whether the growth-inhibitory and 5-FU-sensitivity effects seen here are a direct result of telomerase inhibition."

In order to understand its possible anti-tumor property, we have isolated a number of chemical compounds from the roots of this plant [Phytochemistry 52 (1999) 117] and studied their in vitro effects by using human prostate LNCaP cancer cell line. Among the six compounds tested, jolkinolide B exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative activity (IC50=12.5\u03bcg/mL=40\u03bcM) and it inhibited DNA synthesis by down-regulating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Jolkinolide B, at concentrations up to 25\u03bcg/mL, induced G1 arrest and neuroendocrine differentiation of LNCaP cells. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the increased expression of neuroendocrine markers, keratin 8/18 (K8/18) and neuron specific enolase (NSE), in these cells. Apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation were observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry when the cells were exposed to a concentration higher than 25\u03bcg/mL jolkinolide B. Taken all data together, jolkinolide B seems to play a role in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of LNCaP cells. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved."

The MCF7 breast cancer cell line was chosen as a model system. A series of optimization steps were performed to improve the LC/MS experimental setup, sample preparation, data acquisition and database search protocols, and a data filtering strategy was developed to enable confident identification of a large number of proteins and potential biomarkers. This research has resulted in the identification of >2000 proteins using multiple filtering and p-value sorting. Approximately 1600-1900 proteins had p < 0.001, and, of these, approximately 60% were matched by >or=2 unique peptides. Alternatively, >99% of the proteins identified by >or=2 unique peptides had p < 0.001. When searching the data against a reversed database of proteins, the rate of false positive identifications was 0.1% at the peptide level and 0.4% at the protein level. The typical reproducibility in detecting overlapping proteins across replicate runs exceeded 90% for proteins matched by >or=2 unique peptides. According to their biological function, approximately 200 proteins were involved in cancer-relevant cellular processes, and over 25 proteins were previously described in the literature as putative cancer biomarkers, as they were found to be differentially expressed between normal and cancerous cell states. Among these, biomarkers such PCNA, cathepsin D, E-cadherin, 14-3-3-sigma, antigen Ki-67, TP53RK, and calreticulin were identified.

Taxane responses in human breast cancers correlate positively with the Myc level and negatively with the Bcl-xL level. SUMMARY Taxol and other antimitotic agents are frontline chemotherapy agents but the mechanisms responsible for patient benefit remain unclear. Following a genome-wide siRNA screen, we identified the oncogenic tran-scription factor Myc as a taxol sensitizer. Using time-lapse imaging to correlate mitotic behavior with cell fate, we show that Myc sensitizes cells to mitotic blockers and agents that accelerate mitotic progression. Myc achieves this by upregulating a cluster of redundant pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and suppressing pro-survival Bcl-xL. Gene expression analysis of breast cancers indicates that taxane responses correlate positively with Myc and negatively with Bcl-xL. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-xL restores apoptosis in Myc-deficient cells. These results open up opportunities for biomarkers and combination ther-apies that could enhance traditional and second-generation antimitotic agents."

Gln depletion in MYC-transformed cells induces apoptosis through ATF4-dependent, but p53-independent, PUMA and NOXA induction. MYC-transformed cells depend on both glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase to maintain Gln homeostasis and suppress apoptosis. Consequently, either ATF4 agonists or glutaminolysis inhibitors potently induce apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. These results reveal mechanisms whereby Myc sensitizes cells to apoptosis, and validate ATF4 agonists and inhibitors of Gln metabolism as potential Myc-selective cancer therapeutics. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that breast cancer-initiating cells (CICs) are relatively resistant to radiotherapy; however, the critical mechanisms determining breast CIC resistance to radiation remain elusive. In the present study, a subpopulation of cells displaying characteristics generally attributed to stem cells was identified within the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This subpopulation displays cancer stem cell features characterized by overexpression of embryonic stem cell markers, high tumorigenic potential following transplantation into BALB/c-nu mice, self-renewal capacity and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR). Moreover, glucoseregulated protein 78KD (GRP78), which was found to play a crucial role in stem cell oncogenesis, was also shown to be overexpressed in this subpopulation. GRP78 is required for the cancer stem-like subpopulation cell resistance to IR, as knockdown of this gene augments the effects of IR, while overexpression of GRP78 increases the radiation resistance of the subpopulation to IR. These findings indicate that GRP78 acts as a potential therapeutic target aimed at tumor-generating subsets of breast cancer cells."

        "abstract": "The effects of expression of Drosophila melanoga ster Ca(2+) permeable transient receptor potential-like (TRPL) channels, under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) or prostate cell-specific promoters, on cell survival and apoptosis in the androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line were investigated. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter construct (designated PSAEn/PSAPr) composed of a 0.6 kb region of the promoter and a 1.45 kb region of the enhancer resulted in androgen-dependent and prostate-specific expression of a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected LNCaP cells. Expression of the enhanced green fluorescence protein-TRPL chimeric protein under the control of the CMV promoter was confirmed by Western blot. Whereas the majority of the expressed protein was located in the cytoplasmic space, confocal microscopy with the CD-9 protein as a plasma membrane marker demonstrated that approximately 10% of the expressed TRPL protein was located in a band in the plasma membrane. Using recombinant adenoviruses, expression of the TRPL protein was associated with an increase in both the initial and sustained rates of Ca(2+) inflow. Expression of TRPL under the control of the CMV promoter for 96 hours decreased cell number and increased the number of cells undergoing apoptosis by 23 and 27%, respectively. Apoptosis was inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-fmk. It is concluded that, when heterologously expressed in LNCaP cells, the TRPL protein leads to a reduction in cell survival due, in part, to the induction of apoptosis. The effects of TRPL are likely caused by enhanced Na(+) and Ca(2+) inflow to the cells. This finding suggests a novel approach to modify the growth of prostate cancer cells that fail to undergo apoptosis following androgen ablation therapy."

Many kinds of cell lines and tissues have demonstrated the presence of SP cells, including several gastric cancer cell lines. This study is aimed to identify the cancer stem-like cells in the SP of gastric cancer cell line MKN-45. Methods: We used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort SP cells in the human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-45 (cells labeled with Hoechst 33342) and then characterized the cancer stem-like properties of SP cells. Results: This study found that the SP cells had higher clone formation efficiency than major population (MP) cells. Five stemness-related gene expression profiles, including OCT-4, SOX-2, NANOG, CD44, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters gene ABCG2, were tested in SP and MP cells using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blot was used to show the difference of protein expression between SP and MP cells. Both results show that there was significantly higher protein expression in SP cells than in MP cells. When inoculated into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice, SP cells show higher tumorigenesis tendency than MP cells. Conclusions: These results indicate that SP cells possess cancer stem cell properties and prove that SP cells from MKN-45 are gastric cancer stem-like cells."

Ectopic expression of neuronatin refractory to suppression by miR-708 rescued cell migration and metastasis defects. In patients with breast cancer, miR-708 expression was decreased in lymph node and distal metastases, suggesting a metastasis-suppressive role.

In the present study, we transfected the human ovarian carcinoma cell line HRA, highly invasive cells, with an expression vector harboring a cDNA encoding for human bik. Our study was designed to investigate the effect of bik overexpression and changes in tumor cell phenotype and invasiveness in the stably transfected clones. Bik gene transfection of HRA gave the following results: 1) transfection of HRA with the bik cDNA resulted in 5 variants stably expressing functional bik; 2) bik(+) clones exhibited a significantly reduced uPA mRNA expression as compared to the parental cells; 3) bikunin negatively regulates the ERK1/2 activity; 4) secretion-blocking treatments of bik(+) clones abrogated bik-mediated suppression of ERK1/2 activation and uPA expression; 5) the regulation of invasion seen in the HRA cells is mainly mediated by the uPA-plasmin-MMP-2 system; 6) transfection of HRA with the bik gene significantly reduced invasion, but not proliferation, adhesion, or migration relative to the parental cells; and 7) animals with bik(+) clones induced reduced peritoneal dissemination and long term survival. We conclude that transfection of HRA cells with the bik cDNA constitutively suppresses ERK1/2 activation, which results in inhibition of uPA expression and subsequently reduces dissemination of bik(+) clones."

Here, we show that, contrary to dogma, MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors with mutant p53 exhibited a superior clinical response compared to tumors with wild-type p53. Doxorubicin-treated p53 mutant tumors failed to arrest proliferation, leading to abnormal mitoses and cell death, whereas p53 wild-type tumors arrested, avoiding mitotic catastrophe. Senescent tumor cells persisted, secreting senescence-associated cytokines exhibiting autocrine/paracrine activity and mitogenic potential. Wild-type p53 still mediated arrest and inhibited drug response even in the context of heterozygous p53 point mutations or absence of p21. Thus, we show that wild-type p53 activity hinders chemotherapy response and demonstrate the need to reassess the paradigm for p53 in cancer therapy."

        "abstract": "Breast cancers may evade the growth-inhibitory action of TGFbeta by accumulating defects of unknown nature that selectively eliminate cytostatic gene responses. We found the transcription factor C/EBPbeta to be essential for TGFbeta induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p15INK4b by a FoxO-Smad complex and repression of c-MYC by an E2F4/5-Smad complex in human epithelial cells. These cytostatic responses are selectively missing in metastatic breast cancer cells from half of the patients that we tested. The basis for this loss was traced to an excess of the C/EBPbeta inhibitory isoform LIP. We suggest that C/EBPbeta plays a key role in the coordination of TGFbeta cytostatic gene responses, and its malfunction may trigger evasion of these responses in breast cancer."

By mimicking ORAI protein remodeling observed in primary tumors, we demonstrate in invitro models that enhanced ORAI3 expression favors heteromerization with ORAI1 to form a novel channel. These channels support store-independent Ca2+ entry, thereby promoting cell proliferation and a smaller number of functional homomeric ORAI1-based store-operated channels, which are important in supporting susceptibility to apoptosis. Thus, our findings highlight disrupted dynamic equilibrium of channel-forming proteins as an oncogenic mechanism. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Eight key miRNAs, including miR-506, miR-141, and miR-200a, were predicted to regulate 89% of the targets in this network. Follow-up functional experiments illustrate that miR-506 augmented E-cadherin expression, inhibited cell migration and invasion, and prevented TGF??-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting SNAI2, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human OvCa, miR-506 expression was correlated with decreased SNAI2 and VIM, elevated E-cadherin, and beneficial prognosis.

Cancer cells can resist such killing by premature exit, before cells initiate apoptosis, due to a weak checkpoint or rapid slippage. We reasoned blocking mitotic exit downstream of the checkpoint might circumvent this resistance. Using single-cell approaches, we showed that blocking mitotic exit by Cdc20 knockdown slowed cyclin B1 proteolysis, thus allowed more time for death initiation. Killing by Cdc20 knockdown did not require checkpoint activity and can occur by intrinsic apoptosis or an alternative death pathway when Bcl2 was overexpressed. We conclude targeting Cdc20, or otherwise blocking mitotic exit, may be a better cancer therapeutic strategy than perturbing spindle assembly. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "More than a decade ago, it was found that one of the two essential physiological functions of p53 is to selectively destroy stressed cells through apoptosis. Despite the large number of studies describing p53-dependent apoptosis since then, how p53 turns on the apoptotic switch has remained enigmatic. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Jeffers et al. report that knockout of PUMA, a recently identified BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, recapitulates virtually all apoptotic deficiency in p53 knockout mice. Their results indicate that PUMA is an essential mediator of p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis in vivo."

By probing the surface-protein repertoire of these unique vascular beds, a pioneering draft of a molecular roadmap to decipher the heterogeneity of the vascular system in the context of carcinogenic progression has been plotted. Analysis of these phage peptides that differentially home to dysplastic or invasive tumor vasculature will lay the foundation for identifying unique functional tumor vascular-specific motifs that could potentially be applied to targeted therapeutic and imaging modalities."

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have a proproliferative effect on early embryonic NSC, and a prodifferentiative effect on postnatal NSC. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Lee et al. demonstrate that BMPs have differing effects on different BTSC lines, either promoting or inhibiting an astrocytic-like differentiation program. This latter effect is the result of epigenetic silencing of the BMP receptor 1B (BMPR1B). These findings document the importance of the BMP signaling system in BTSC as well as that of taking heterogeneity into account when studying BTSC as potential targets for therapy."

        "abstract": "A chemical genetics approach identified a cellular target of several proapoptotic farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs). Treatment with these FTIs caused p53-independent apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans, which was mimicked by knockdown of endosomal trafficking proteins, including Rab5, Rab7, the HOPS complex, and notably the enzyme Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGT). These FTIs were found to inhibit mammalian RabGGT with potencies that correlated with their proapoptotic activity. Knockdown of RabGGT induced apoptosis in mammalian cancer cell lines, and both RabGGT subunits were overexpressed in several tumor tissues. These findings validate RabGGT, and by extension endosomal function, as a therapeutically relevant target for modulation of apoptosis, and enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of FTIs.

In this study, we screened various human cancer cell lines including gastric cancer cell lines and found first time that miR-372 is expressed only in AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. Inhibition of miR-372 using antisense miR-372 oligonucleotide (AS-miR-372) suppressed proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase, and increased apoptosis of AGS cells. Furthermore, AS-miR-372 treatment increased expression of LATS2, while over-expression of miR-372 decreased luciferase reporter activity driven by the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of LATS2 mRNA. Over-expression of LATS2 induced changes in AGS cells similar to those in AGS cells treated with AS-miR-372. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an oncogenic role for miR-372 in controlling cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis through down-regulation of a tumor suppressor gene, LATS2."

Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 60%-70% of breast tumors, independent of ER status. How androgens and AR regulate breast cancer growth remains largely unknown. We find that AR is enriched in ER- breast tumors that overexpress HER2. Through analysis of the AR cistrome and androgen-regulated gene expression in ER-/HER2+ breast cancers we find that AR mediates ligand-dependent activation of Wnt and HER2 signaling pathways through direct transcriptional induction of WNT7B and HER3. Specific targeting of AR, Wnt or HER2 signaling impairs androgen-stimulated tumor cell growth suggesting potential therapeutic approaches for ER-/HER2+ breast cancers. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Microarray expression analysis was used to determine whether global biological differences underlie common pathological features of prostate cancer and to identify genes that might anticipate the clinical behavior of this disease. While no expression correlates of age, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and measures of local invasion were found, a set of genes was identified that strongly correlated with the state of tumor differentiation as measured by Gleason score. Moreover, a model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy. These results support the notion that the clinical behavior of prostate cancer is linked to underlying gene expression differences that are detectable at the time of diagnosis.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Resveratrol (Calbiochem, La Jolla, California) is a naturally occurring stilbene reported to cause apoptosis in various cultured cancer cells. In the current study the effect of resveratrol was determined in the androgen insensitive DU 145 prostate cancer cell line. Induction of apoptosis and activation of apoptosis related signal transduction pathways were measured.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: DU 145 cells were treated with resveratrol and apoptosis was measured by determining nucleosome content. Activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), p53 content and serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 were measured by immunoblot. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of p53 binding to DNA, and measurement of p21 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase messenger RNA were also done.\\n\\nRESULTS: Resveratrol induced apoptosis in DU 145 cells. The stilbene activated MAPK and caused increased abundance of p53 and serine-15 phosphorylated p53. Resveratrol induced serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 was blocked by PD 98059 (Calbiochem), a MAPK kinase inhibitor, implicating MAPK activation in the phosphorylation of p53. PD 98059 also inhibited resveratrol induced apoptosis. These results suggest that apoptosis induction by resveratrol in DU 145 cells requires serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 by MAPK. Inhibition of MAPK dependent serine-15 phosphorylation resulted in reduced p53 binding to a p53 specific oligonucleotide on electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Pifithrin-alpha (Calbiochem), a p53 inhibitor, blocked resveratrol induced serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 and p53 binding to DNA. Resveratrol caused a p53 stimulated increase in p21 messenger RNA. Transfection of additional wild-type p53 into DU 145 cells induced apoptosis, which was further enhanced by resveratrol treatment.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol causes apoptosis in DU 145 prostate cancer cells. This action depends on the activation of MAPK, increase in cellular p53 content, serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 and increased p53 binding to DNA."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An in vitro model was developed to understand if celecoxib could synergize with Mitomycin C (MMC), commonly used for the prevention of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer recurrence, and eventually elucidate if the mechanism of interaction involves multi drug resistance (MDR) transporters.\\n\\nMETHODS: UMUC-3, a non COX-2 expressing bladder cancer cell line, and UMUC-3-CX, a COX-2 overexpressing transfectant, as well as 5637, a COX-2 overexpressing cell line, and 5637si-CX, a non COX-2 expressing silenced 5637 cell line, were used in the present study. The expression of COX-2 and MDR pumps (P-gp, MDR-1 and BCRP) was explored through western blot. The anti-proliferative effect of celecoxib and MMC was studied with MTT test. Three biological permeability assays (Drug Transport Experiment, Substrate Transporter Inhibition, and ATP cell depletion) were combined to study the interaction between MDR transporters and celecoxib. Finally, the ability of celecoxib to restore MMC cell accumulation was investigated.\\n\\nRESULTS: The anti-proliferative effect of celecoxib and MMC were investigated alone and in co-administration, in UMUC-3, UMUC-3-CX, 5637 and 5637si-CX cells. When administered alone, the effect of MMC was 8-fold greater in UMUC-3. However, co-administration of 1 \u03bcM, 5 \u03bcM, and 10 \u03bcM celecoxib and MMC caused a 2,3-fold cytotoxicity increase in UMUC-3-CX cell only. MMC cytotoxicity was not affected by celecoxib co-administration either in 5637, or in 5637si-CX cells. As a result of all finding from the permeability experiments, celecoxib was classified as P-gp unambiguous substrate: celecoxib is transported by MDR pumps and interferes with the efflux of MMC. Importantly, among all transporters, BCRP was only overexpressed in UMUC-3-CX cells, but not in 5637 and 5637si-CX.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The UMUC-3-CX cell line resembles a more aggressive phenotype with a lower response to MMC compared to the wt counterpart. However, the administration of celecoxib in combination to MMC causes a significant and dose dependent gain of the anti-proliferative activity. This finding may be the result of a direct interaction between celecoxib and MDR transporters. Indeed, BCRP is overexpressed in UMUC-3-CX, but not in UMUC-3, 5637, and 5637si-CX, in which celecoxib is ineffective."

Using a luciferase assay, the apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) mRNA 3'-UTR was shown to have complementary binding sites using bioinformatics prediction software including TargetScan, PicTar and miRanda. In conclusion, our results showed that miR-221 inhibition caused elevated expression levels of the Apaf-1 apoptotic pathway proteins caspase-3, -8 and -9. miR-221 may therefore be used as a novel therapeutic target for laryngeal cancer."

To directly study the role of DNA methltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the regulation of expression of tumor-related genes in human colon cancer cells, we stably transfected expression constructs containing sense or antisense DNMT1 into the human colon cancer cell line, SW1116. The expression level of mismatch repair genes (MMR), human mut-L homologue 1 (hMLH1) and human Mut S homologue 2 (hMSH2), was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. The methylation status of hMLH1 and hMSH2 promoters was determined by bisulfite modification and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The protein levels of DNMT1 hMSH2 and hMLH1 were determined by Western analysis. The results show that DNMT1 protein expression was increased or decreased in transfected cell lines containing sense or antisense DNMT1 constructs, respectively. In cells expressing the sense DNMT1 construct, the expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2 was down-regulated through hypermethylation of their respective promoters. Furthermore, antisense DNMT1 expression induced promoter demethylation and up-regulated transcription of hMSH2 (P < 0.05) and hMLH1 (P=0.064) in SW 1116 cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation is now recognized as an important epigenetic alteration occurring early in human cancer. To directly study the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the regulation of expression of tumor-related genes in human colon cancer cells, we stably transfected expression constructs containing sense or antisense DNMT1 into the human colon cancer cell line, SW1116. The expression level of mismatch repair genes (MMR), human mut-L homologue 1 (hMLH1) and human Mut S homologue 2 (hMSH2), was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. The methylation status of hMLH1 and hMSH2 promoters was determined by bisulfite modification and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The protein levels of DNMT1, hMSH2 and hMLH1 were determined by Western analysis. The results show that DNMT1 protein expression was increased or decreased in transfected cell lines containing sense or antisense DNMT1 constructs, respectively. In cells expressing the sense DNMT1 construct, the expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2 was down-regulated through hypermethylation of their respective promoters. Furthermore, antisense DNMT1 expression induced promoter demethylation and up-regulated transcription of hMSH2 (P<0.05) and hMLH1 (P=0.064) in SW1116 cells."

To evaluate this model, we analyzed methylation in CpG islands from six mutator and suppressor genes, and thirty random genomic sites, in a panel of colorectal cancers. Tumor-specific somatic hypermethylation was a widespread age-dependent process that followed a normal Gaussian distribution. Because there was no discontinuity in methylation rate, our results challenge the methylator phenotype hypothesis and its hypothetical pathological underlying defect. We also show that the mutator phenotype dominates over the gradual accumulation of DNA hypermethylation in determining the genotypic features that govern the phenotypic peculiarities of colon cancer of the mutator pathway."

Neochromosomes, which can exceed 600 Mb in size, initially arise as circular structures following chromothripsis involving chromosome 12. The core of the neochromosome is amplified, rearranged, and corroded through hundreds of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Under selective pressure, amplified oncogenes are overexpressed, while coamplified passenger genes may be silenced epigenetically. New material may be captured during punctuated chromothriptic events. Centromeric corrosion leads to crisis, which is resolved through neocentromere formation or native centromere capture. Finally, amplification terminates, and the neochromosome core is stabilized in linear form by telomere capture. This study investigates the dynamic mutational processes underlying the life history of a special form of cancer mutation."

We have previously shown that alterations in Arl2 protein content were associated with corresponding modifications of the tumor suppressor PP2Ac protein content in breast cancer cells. Here, we show that modified Arl2 expression level influences sensitivity to various anticancer compounds such as taxol, navelbine, gemcitabine and doxorubicin in MCF7 derived cell lines. Modifications of Arl2 expression levels were also associated with an altered phosphorylation status and/or cellular sublocalization of certain PP2A targets such as p53, a key mediator of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. A decreased level of Arl2 expression was associated with an increase of phospho-ser15-p53, a form which was found to be preferentially bound to microtubules. Assays using okadaic and cantharidic acid, two different PP2A inhibitors, showed an increase in microtubule-bound phospho-p53 and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our results suggest that Arl2 could, via PP2A, influence p53 phosphorylation status. Certain forms of phosphorylated p53 demonstrating increased binding to microtubules appear to be less prone to nuclear translocation after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, thereby possibly contributing to reduced chemosensitivity."

Inhibition of one activates the other, thereby maintaining tumor cell survival.

This inhibitory effect is due to the ROS-induced activation of p38?? early in the process of transformation, which induces apoptosis and prevents the accumulation of ROS and their carcinogenic effects. Accordingly, highly tumorigenic cancer cell lines have developed a mechanism to uncouple p38?? activation from ROS production.

We aimed to study the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, nimesulide, on cell viability and telomerase and Akt/PKB activity in the human gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 and to explore the molecular mechanism for the antitumor activity of the selective COX-2 inhibitor. We tested the influence of nimesulide on the gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 in vitro. Trypan blue exclusion was used to determine the cell viability after incubation for 0, 12, 24, and 48 hr in different concentrations of nimesulide 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 microM). After treatment or no treatment with 100 microM nimesulide for 0, 12, 24, or 48 hr in the presence or absence of 300 nM okadaic acid for 2 hr, telomerase and Akt/PKB activity was measured using TRAP PCR-ELISA and nonradioactive IP kinase assays, respectively. In the gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 nimesulide caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction in cell numbers and significantly inhibited telomerase and Akt/PKB activity; the inhibition of telomerase activity was partly associated with the attenuation of Akt/PKB activity. These results demonstrate that the selective COX-2 inhibitor suppresses the telomerase activity of gastric cancer cells, in part by blocking the activation of protein kinase B, which provides a new signaling mechanism responsible for the anticancer effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor."

In this study, we established a CD44(+) colorectal cancer stem cell line with particular emphasis on its self-renewal capacity, enhanced tumor initiation and drug resistance. METHODS: Fresh colon cancer and paired normal colon tissues were collected from 13 patients who had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery. Among the 6 single-cell derived clones, only the P6C cell line was cultured for more than 20 passages in serial culture and formed holoclones with high efficiency, and then the stemness gene expression, colony formation, tumorigenicity and drug sensitivities of the P6C cell line were examined. RESULTS: Stemness proteins, including c-Myc, Oct3/4, Nanog, Lgr5, and SOX2, were highly expressed in the P6C cell line. Oct3/4-positive P6C cells mostly generated holoclones through symmetric division, while a small number of P6C cells generated meroclones through asymmetric division. P6C cells stably expressed CD44 and possessed a high capacity to form tumor spheres. A single cell-derived sphere was capable of generating xenograft tumors in nude mice. Compared to SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, P6C cells were highly resistant to Camptothecin and 5-fluorouracil, the commonly used chemotherapeutic agents to treat colorectal cancers. CONCLUSION: We established a colorectal cancer stem cell line P6C with a high tumorigenic capacity and the characteristics of normal stem cells. It will benefit the mechanistic studies on cancer stem cells and the development of drugs that specifically target the cancer stem cells."

The most common reporters include firefly luciferase (bioluminescence imaging), green fluorescence protein (fluorescence imaging), herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase (positron emission tomography), and variants with enhanced spectral and kinetic properties. When cloned into promoter/enhancer sequences or engineered into fusion proteins, imaging reporters allow transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, protein-protein interactions, oncogenic transformation, cell trafficking, and targeted drug action to be spatiotemporally resolved in vivo. Spying on cancer with genetically encoded imaging reporters provides insight into cancer-specific molecular machinery within the context of the whole animal."

We uncover the mechanism by which these mutants are selectively attenuated in interferon-responsive cells while remaining highly lytic in 80% of human tumor cell lines tested. AV1 and AV2 were tested in a xenograft model of human ovarian cancer and in an immune competent mouse model of metastatic colon cancer. While highly attenuated for growth in normal mice, both AV1 and AV2 effected complete and durable cures in the majority of treated animals when delivered systemically."

They are also often associated with a high level of free monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated (SFA) fatty acids. We studied the effect of DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on these anomalies in a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. Inhibitors of the Akt T308 kinase (PDK1) or S473 kinase (mTORC2, DNA-dependent protein kinase and integrin-linked kinase) and combinations of two of them incompletely inhibited, or even enhanced, the phosphorylation in this cell line. In contrast, it was found that DHA as well as other PUFAs inhibited Akt phosphorylation on T308 after 24 h. These PUFAs also blocked phosphorylation of S473, although certain omega-6 PUFAs were ineffective. After 48 h, only DHA inhibited Akt phosphorylation on the both residues. DHA, and other PUFAs though less efficiently, also elevated the expression of a mitochondrial enzyme, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, which catalyzes process necessary for \u03b2-oxidation of PUFAs. These PUFAs were present in the cells at high concentrations and reduced the amount of free and phospholipid-bound MUFAs. DHA most efficiently blocked deregulated cell proliferation while the effects of other PUFAs were moderate. These results suggest that DHA suppressed the growth of the cancer cell through its specifically persistent block of Akt phosphorylation in conjunction with modulation of fatty acid metabolism. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The potent anti-cancer agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) is currently used for treating bladder cancer. However, clinical use of this drug for long periods is often limited because of the appearance of cisplatin-resistant bladder tumor cells. We employed the method of a differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to identify the differentially expressed genes in the parental human bladder cancer cell line, T24 and three cisplatin-resistant cell lines. We report here that cisplatin-resistant cell lines overexpress Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-2-related gene expressed in fetal liver (Bfl-1)/A1 as compared with their parental cell. Cisplatin and gamma-irradiation induced expression of Bfl-1/A1 in T24R2 cells but not in T24 cells. Among Bcl-2 family members, Bfl-1/A1 showed the most significant alteration of the expression level in resistant cells. The nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by cisplatin and gamma-irradiation selectively occurred in T24R2 cells. Mitochondrial depolarization and cell death by cisplatin were also prevented in T24R2 cells. Moreover, Bfl-1/A1 inhibited cisplatin- and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in BOSC23 cells. Our findings suggest that the induction of Bfl-1/A1 by NF-kappaB may be important in controlling resistance to cisplatin responses in bladder tumor cells."

In p53-mutant tumors, cell cycle checkpoints are rewired, leading to dependency on the p38/MK2 pathway to survive DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Here we show that the RNA binding protein hnRNPA0 is the \"successor\" to p53 for checkpoint control. Like p53, hnRNPA0 is activated by a checkpoint kinase (MK2) and simultaneously controls both cell cycle checkpoints through distinct target mRNAs, but unlike p53, this is through the post-transcriptional stabilization of p27Kip1 and Gadd45\u03b1 mRNAs. This pathway drives cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, demonstrating the importance of post-transcriptional RNA control to chemotherapy response."

We report a mechanism explaining how interstitial flow caused by lymphatic drainage directs tumor cell migration by autocrine CCR7 signaling. Under static conditions, lymphatic endothelium induced CCR7-dependent chemotaxis of tumor cells through 3D matrices. However, interstitial flow induced strong increases in tumor cell migration that were also CCR7 dependent, but lymphatic independent. This autologous chemotaxis correlated with metastatic potential in four cell lines and was verified by visualizing directional polarization of cells in the flow direction. Computational modeling revealed that transcellular gradients of CCR7 ligand were created under flow to drive this response. This illustrates how tumor cells may be guided to lymphatics during metastasis. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Using a chemical genomic approach, it was determined that activation of the Her2/IGF-1R signaling pathways and subsequent C-MYC stabilization upregulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 beta (PGC-1??), an obligate cofactor for ERR?? activity.

Using a mammary chimera model in which an irradiated host is transplanted with oncogenic Trp53 null epithelium, we show accelerated development of aggressive tumors whose molecular signatures were distinct from tumors arising in nonirradiated hosts. Molecular and genetic approaches show that TGF?? mediated tumor acceleration. Tumor molecular signatures implicated TGF??, and genetically reducing TGF?? abrogated the effect on latency. Surprisingly, tumors from irradiated hosts were predominantly estrogen receptor negative. This effect was TGF?? independent and linked to mammary stem cell activity. Thus, the irradiated microenvironment affects latency and clinically relevant features of cancer through distinct and unexpected mechanisms. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Cross-species computational analysis of these interactomes has identified FOXM1 and CENPF as synergistic master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Experimental validation shows that FOXM1 and CENPF function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy. Furthermore, co-expression of FOXM1 and CENPF is a robust prognostic indicator of poor survival and metastasis. Thus, genome-wide cross-species interrogation of regulatory networks represents a valuable strategy to identify causal mechanisms of human cancer."

All-trans retinoic acid (tRA) treatment stimulated iodide uptake in a time- and dose-dependent fashion up to approximately 9.4-fold above baseline. Stimulation with selective retinoid compounds indicated that the induction of iodide uptake was mediated by retinoic acid receptor. Treatment with tRA markedly stimulated NIS mRNA and immunoreactive protein ( approximately 68 kDa). tRA stimulated NIS gene transcription approximately 4-fold, as shown by nuclear run-on assay. No induction of iodide uptake was observed with RA treatment of an ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB 231, or a normal human breast cell line, MCF-12A. The iodide efflux rate of tRA-treated MCF-7 cells was slow (t(1/2) = 24 min), compared with that in FRTL-5 thyroid cells (t(1/2) = 3.9 min), favoring iodide retention in MCF-7 cells. An in vitro clonogenic assay demonstrated selective cytotoxicity with (131)I after tRA stimulation of MCF-7 cells. tRA up-regulates NIS gene expression and iodide uptake in an ER-positive breast cancer cell line. Stimulation of radioiodide uptake after systemic retinoid treatment may be useful for diagnosis and treatment of some differentiated breast cancers."

Butyric acid, alpha-linoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were supplemented at 200 microM concentration in the medium of cell cultures. Our results showed that all fatty acids inhibited cell growth, whereas only DHA induced cell apoptosis. An oxidative process was implicated in apoptosis induced by DHA because butylated hydroxytoluene and vitamin E prevented lipid peroxidation and reversed apoptosis. Intracellular and extracellular glutathione [reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG)] concentrations were measured following DHA treatment in the presence or in the absence of GSH extrusion inhibitors such as cystathionine or methionine. DHA induced intracellular GSH depletion without affecting intracellular GSSG concentration and increased extracellular GSH and GSSG levels. Intracellular GSH depletion and extracellular GSH increase were both reversed by cystathionine. Inhibition of active GSH extrusion from the cell by cystathionine or methionine completely reversed lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. These data document the antiproliferative and apoptotic activities of DHA. The date provide evidence that intracellular GSH depletion represents an active extrusion process rather than a consequence of an oxidative stress, suggesting a causative role of GSH depletion in DHA-induced apoptosis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tumors have emerged as progenitors involved in stroma formation and metastasis of cancers, partially owing to their abilities to differentially express paracrine factors related to the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. In this regard, increasing evidence has shown that MSCs have impacts on the malignancy of colon cancer, however, the underpinning mechanisms by which MSCs promote cancer metastasis remain elusive. METHODS: To investigate the crosstalk between adipose-derived MSCs (AMSCs) isolated from adipose tissues and colon cancer cells, a co-culture transwell model of AMSCs and colon cancer cells was employed, and the activation of Wnt signaling and paracrine factors in colon cancer cells and AMSCs were measured. RESULTS: The results showed that AMSCs could enhance the metastatic capacity of colon cancer cells with an elevated expression of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (EMT)-associated genes in a contact-dependent manner. Reciprocally, colon cancer cells were able to induce AMSCs to produce metastasis-related factors and cytokines, such as FGF10, VEGFC and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in part through a mechanism of an activation of Wnt signaling, by which these factors in turn activate Wnt signaling of colon cancer cells. Intriguingly, an inhibition of Wnt signaling leads a reduced capacity of invasion and colony formation of colon cancer cells in vitro, and the tumorigenicity of cancer cells in a murine model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings thus suggest that the crosstalk between the Wnt signaling of cancer cells and paracrine factors of AMSCs has an implication in colon cancer malignancy. This study thus uncovers a novel Wnt-paracrine factors mediated-crosstalk between colon cancer cells and AMSCs in cancer malignancy."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To explore the effects of nm23-H1 gene transfection and forskolin on PKA activity in human high-metastasis large cell lung cancer cell line L9981. METHODS: Three cell lines, primary human large cell lung cancer cell line (L9981), vector transfection cell line (L9981-pLXSN) and nm23-H1 gene transfection cell line (L9981-nm23-H1-pLXSN), were treated with PKA activator forskolin. The PKA activity at different time points after treatment with forskolin was detected in the three lung cancer cell lines by radioimmunological method with SignaTECT cAMP-dependent PKA assay system. RESULTS: (1) Before forskolin treatment, the activity of PKA of L9981-nm23-H1-pLXSN was remarkably higher than those of L9981 and L9981-pLXSN (P < 0.01), but no significant difference in the PKA activity was observed between L9981 and L9981-pLXSN (P > 0.05). (2)The PKA activity was remarkably increased in all the three lung cancer cell lines after treatment with different concentration of forskolin (P < 0.01), and up to the highest level at the concentration of 100 mumol/L. It showed a dose-dependent relationship between the PKA activity and forskolin concentration; (3) The PKA activity in all the three cell lines was elevated to the highest level at 30 minutes after treatment with forskolin of 100 mumol/L, and it showed a time-dependent relationship between the PKA activity and action time of forskolin. CONCLUSIONS: (1)Transfection of nm23-H1 gene can up-regulate the PKA activity of human high-metastasis large cell lung cancer cell line L9981, and its function as a tumor metastasis suppressor gene may be related to its effects on regulation of PKA signal transduction pathways; (2)Forskolin can remarkably up-regulate the PKA activity of L9981 cell line, and the elevation of PKA activity has a time-dependent and dose-dependent relation to forskolin."

        "abstract": "Trichostatin A (TSA) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) have been reported to affect histone modifications. To investigate the effects of two drugs that can reportedly affect chromatin remodeling, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of TSA and AdoHcy in a gastric cancer cell line using 14 K cDNA microarray. The significant analysis of microarray (SAM) identified 98 and 43 differentially expressed genes in TSA and AdoHcy treated sets, respectively, and selected genes were functionally classified. In the gastric cancer cell line, genes related to cell communication, cell growth/maintenance, and morphogenesis were highly expressed with TSA, and genes with cell growth/maintenance, metabolism, oxidoreductase activity were upregulated with AdoHcy. Genes downregulated with TSA included those controlling the cell cycle, cell growth/proliferation, DNA binding, and metabolism, whereas genes involved in calcium signaling, cell growth/proliferation, and metabolism were downregulated with AdoHcy. Furthermore, we identified the genes commonly expressed in both drug treatments. Compared to TSA, AdoHcy did not induce apoptosis in the SNU-16 gastric cancer cell line, and RT-PCR was performed for selective genes to confirm the microarray data. This gene expression profile analysis with TSA and AdoHcy should contribute to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanism of chromatin remodeling and cancer, and provide candidate genes for further studies involving the roles of histone modifications in gastric cancer."

METHODS: Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (SPC-A-1) was treated in vitro with 0.5mug/ml Tanshinone IIA for five days, and the cells treated with all trans retinoic acid (RA) and DDP as control. Changes in cell morphology, proliferation dynamics, cell cycle distribution and tumor-related gene expression were detected. RESULTS: The cell growth and rate of clone formation of SPC-A-1 cells were markedly inhibited in Tanshinone group than RA group. Flow cytometry demonstrated that S phase cells decreased and G/G phase cells increased in Tanshinone group. Expression of p53, p21 was up-regulated obviously but CDKN was down-regulated markedly by Tanshinone IIA. CONCLUSIONS: Tanshinone IIA can inhibit cell growth and clone formation in human lung cancer cell line (SPC-A-1) and its possible molecular mechanism may be inhibiting DNA synthesis by up-regulating p53, p21 and down-regulating CDKN."

H-prune physically interacts with nm23-H1, a metastasis suppressor gene. The h-prune PDE activity, suppressed by dipyridamole and enhanced by the interaction with nm23-H1, stimulates cellular motility and metastasis processes. Out of 59 metastatic breast cancer cases analyzed, 22 (37%) were found to overexpress h-prune, evidence that this novel enzymatic activity is involved in promoting cancer metastasis."

A combinatorial drug screen on multiple PIK3CA mutant cancers with decreased sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors revealed that combined CDK 4/6-PI3K inhibition synergistically reduces cell viability. Laboratory studies revealed that sensitive cancers suppress RB phosphorylation upon treatment with single-agent PI3K inhibitors but cancers with reduced sensitivity fail to do so. Similarly, patients' tumors that responded to the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 demonstrated suppression of pRB, while nonresponding tumors showed sustained or increased levels of pRB. Importantly, the combination of PI3K and CDK 4/6 inhibitors overcomes intrinsic and adaptive resistance leading to tumor regressions in PIK3CA mutant xenografts. ???Synergy exists between inhibitions of CDK 4/6 and PI3K in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer.???CDK 4/6-PI3K inhibition is effective in several PIK3CA mutant xenograft tumor models.???Failure to suppress pRB correlates with resistance to PI3K inhibitors in patients. PI3K inhibitors have only modest clinical efficacy in breast cancers with an aberrantly activated PI3K pathway. Vora etal. show that inhibiting CDK 4/6 overcomes intrinsic and adaptive resistance to PI3K inhibitors in these tumors and that reduction of phosphorylated RB is a good biomarker for the response. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Using a hyperplasia transplant system, we show that tumor dissemination and metastasis occur in discrete steps during tumor progression. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that loss of the transcription factor GATA-3 marked progression from adenoma to early carcinoma and onset of tumor dissemination. Restoration of GATA-3 in late carcinomas induced tumor differentiation and suppressed tumor dissemination. Targeted deletion of GATA-3 in early tumors led to apoptosis of differentiated cells, indicating that its loss is not sufficient for malignant conversion. Rather, malignant progression occurred with an expanding GATA-3-negative tumor cell population. These data indicate that GATA-3 regulates tumor differentiation and suppresses tumor dissemination in breast cancer. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Here we show that loss of ATRX suppresses the timely resolution of sister telomere cohesion that normally occurs prior to mitosis. In the absence of ATRX, the histone variant macroH2A1.1 binds to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase tankyrase 1, preventing it from localizing to telomeres and resolving cohesion. The resulting persistent telomere cohesion promotes recombination between sister telomeres, while it suppresses inappropriate recombination between non-sisters. Forced resolution of sister telomere cohesion induces excessive recombination between non-homologs, genomic instability, and impaired cell growth, indicating the ATRX-macroH2A1.1-tankyrase axis as a potential therapeutic target in ALT tumors."

Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D3-CDK6. We identified the Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. CDK4/6 stabilize and activate FOXM1, thereby maintain expression of G1/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence.

Both intravenous siRNA against Lin28b and conditional Lin28b deletion reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival.

We identify regulation of the L-glutamine carrier proteins SLC1A5 and SLC38A2 (SLC1A5/38A2) by the ubiquitin ligase RNF5. Paclitaxel-induced ER stress to breast cancer (BCa) cells promotes RNF5 association, ubiquitination, and degradation of SLC1A5/38A2. This decreases Gln uptake, levels of TCA cycle components, mTOR signaling, and proliferation while increasing autophagy and cell death. Rnf5-deficient MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors were less differentiated and showed elevated SLC1A5 expression. Whereas RNF5 depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells promoted tumorigenesis and abolished paclitaxel responsiveness, SLC1A5/38A2 knockdown elicited opposing effects. Inverse RNF5hi/SLC1A5/38A2lo expression was associated with positive prognosis in BCa. Thus, RNF5 control of Gln uptake underlies BCa response to chemotherapies."

The formation of CSCs from non-stem cells involves a shift from EGFR to PDGFR signaling and results in the PKCalpha-dependent activation of FRA1. We identified an AP-1 molecular switch in which c-FOS and FRA1 are preferentially utilized in non-CSCs and CSCs, respectively. PKCalpha and FRA1 expression is associated with the aggressive triple-negative breast cancers, and the depletion of FRA1 results in a mesenchymal-epithelial transition.

Furthermore, we observed CCR2-dependent infiltration of myeloid cells after treatment and that Ccr2 null host mice responded better to treatment with doxorubicin or cisplatin.

Such inhibition depends on targeting disruption of the ER DNA-binding domain and its communication with neighboring functional domains, facilitating ER\u03b1 dissociation from its coactivator AIB1 and concomitant association with its corepressor NCoR bound to chromatin. DIBA does not affect phosphorylation of HER2, MAPK, AKT, and AIB1, suggesting that DIBA-modified ER\u03b1 may induce a switch from agonistic to antagonistic effects of TAM on resistant breast cancer cells. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        "title": "Multidrug resistance in a urothelial cancer cell line after 1-hour mitomycin C exposure",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: A factor pertinent to the design of cancer chemotherapy is multidrug resistance. Research in this area conventionally involves in vitro models using resistant cell lines generated by continuous low dose drug exposure for many months, unlike the exposure experienced by residual superficial bladder cancer cells during chemotherapy adjuvant to resection. Recently we noted a measure of multidrug resistance induced by 3 short exposures to mitomycin C during 10 weeks. We currently report detectable functional resistance after a single 1-hour insult. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RT112 bladder cancer cells (Catalog No. ACC 418, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were exposed to a range of mitomycin C concentrations for 1 hour. Cells regrew in 3 of 24 cultures at 15.6, 3.91 and 0.98 mg/ml exposure. These cells were subjected to 3 functional tests of cross resistance to epirubicin, including MTT cytotoxicity assay, quantitative accumulation by flow cytometry and nuclear uptake or exclusion by live cell fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: MTT assay and flow cytometry revealed clear indications of resistance. Intracellular distribution, in which nuclear exclusion indicates resistance, was distinctively resistant in 1 subline and another 2 were equivocal. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that some multidrug resistance potential exists even in a cloned cell line that is capable of surviving 1 short drug exposure and expanding after that insult. The exposures used are consistent with those probably experienced by many superficial transitional cell carcinoma cells during an intravesical chemotherapy application. The result gives added weight to considering multidrug resistance induction in dose scheduling or drug combinations for topical chemotherapy."

We established mouse cancer models, which allowed targeting of an oncogene by drug-mediated inactivation or monospecific CD8 + effector T (T E) cells. Drug treatment of genetically unstable large tumors was effective but selected resistant clones in the long term. In contrast, T E cells completely rejected large tumors (\u2265500 mm 3), if the target antigen was cancer-driving and expressed in sufficient amounts. Although drug-mediated oncogene inactivation selectively killed the cancer cells and left the tumor vasculature intact, which likely facilitated survival and growth of resistant clones, T E cell treatment led to blood vessel destruction and probably \" bystander\" elimination of escape variants, which did not require antigen cross-presentation by stromal cells. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Here, we report that GATA3 nucleates a transcription repression program composed of G9A and MTA3-, but not MTA1- or MTA2-, constituted NuRD complex. Genome-wide analysis of the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) targets identified a cohort of genes including ZEB2 that are critically involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion. We demonstrate that the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) complex inhibits the invasive potential of breast cancer cells invitro and suppresses breast cancer metastasis invivo. Strikingly, the expression of GATA3, G9A, and MTA3 is concurrently downregulated during breast cancer progression, leading to an elevated expression of ZEB2, which, in turn, represses the expression of G9A and MTA3 through the recruitment of G9A/NuRD(MTA1)."

Moreover, upon EWS-FLI1 silencing, two different Ewing cell lines can differentiate along the adipogenic lineage when incubated in appropriate differentiation cocktails. In addition, Ewing cells can also differentiate along the osteogenic lineage upon long-term inhibition of EWS-FLI1.

Integrin expression of these subclones was evaluated by flow cytometry. In vitro cell attachment, migration and proliferation assays with ECMs were performed using these subclones. Expression of integrin alpha3 subunit was higher in EBC-1/brain than in both EBC-1/original and EBC-1/bone. In vitro cell attachment, migration, and proliferation assays revealed that EBC-1/brain had higher affinity and higher reactivity to laminin than EBC-1/original and EBC-1/bone. Blocking of integrin alpha3beta1 significantly (P < 0.05) decreased brain metastasis by EBC-1/brain. Interaction of integrin alpha3beta1 and laminin plays important roles in the process of brain metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer."

Here, we explore the role of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins in DLBCL, using integrative chemical genetics and functional epigenomics. We observe highly asymmetric loading of bromodomain 4 (BRD4) at enhancers, with approximately 33% of all BRD4 localizing to enhancers at 1.6% of occupied genes. These super-enhancers prove particularly sensitive to bromodomain inhibition, explaining the selective effect of BET inhibitors on oncogenic and lineage-specific transcriptional circuits. Functional study of genes marked by super-enhancers identifies DLBCLs dependent on OCA-B and suggests a strategy for discovering unrecognized cancer dependencies. Translational studies performed on a comprehensive panel of DLBCLs establish a therapeutic rationale for evaluating BET inhibitors in this disease."

Transcriptional repressors and MCL1 shRNAs induced apoptosis in the same cancer cell lines and could be rescued by physiological levels of ectopic MCL1 expression. Repression of MCL1 released the proapoptotic protein BAK from MCL1, and Bak deficiency conferred resistance to transcriptional repressors. A computational model, validated in vivo, indicated that high BCL-xL expression confers resistance to MCL1 repression, thereby identifying a patient-selection strategy for the clinical development of MCL1 inhibitors. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc."

Inhibition of JAK2 and JMJD2C cooperated in killing these lymphomas by decreasing tyrosine 41 phosphorylation and increasing lysine 9 trimethylation of histone H3, promoting heterochromatin formation.

Expression of MDM2, the negative regulator of p53, was upregulated in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner in growth factor-independent BCR/ABL-expressing cells, and in accelerated phase and blast crisis CML samples. Increased MDM2 expression was associated with enhanced mdm2 mRNA translation, which required the interaction of the La antigen with mdm2 5\u2032 UTR. Expression of MDM2 correlated with that of La and was suppressed by La siRNAs and by a dominant negative La mutant, which also enhanced the susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis of BCR/ABL-transformed cells. By contrast, La overexpression led to increased MDM2 levels and enhanced resistance to apoptosis.

Results: F. gummosa Boiss. extracts inhibited the cell proliferation of AGS cell line in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 37.47??g/mL for flower and 32.99??g/mL for leaf extracts. F. gummosa Boiss. extracts also induced apoptosis as shown by analysis of DNA fragmentation and plasma membrane translocation of phosphatidyl serine.

A recent report by suggests that a structural motif, a death domain (DD), present in one of the mammalian NF-kappaB proteins, NF-kappaB2/p100, allows it to directly activate cell death in a transcription-independent manner. Further, it is suggested that loss of the proapoptotic function of NF-kappaB2/p100 is directly linked to its oncogenic activity in lymphomas."

The result is consistent that ChRCC originates from the distal nephron compared with other kidney cancers with more proximal origins. Combined mtDNA and gene expression analysis implicates changes in mitochondrial function as a component of the disease biology, while suggesting alternative roles for mtDNA mutations in cancers relying on oxidative phosphorylation. Genomic rearrangements lead to recurrent structural breakpoints within TERT promoter region, which correlates with highly elevated TERT expression and manifestation of kataegis, representing a mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancer distinct from previously observed amplifications and point mutations."

        "abstract": "KRAS is mutated in \u223c40% of colorectal cancer (CRC), and there are limited effective treatments for advanced KRAS mutant CRC. Therefore, it is crucial that downstream mediators of oncogenic KRAS continue to be studied. We identified p190RhoGAP as being phosphorylated in the DLD1 CRC cell line, which expresses a heterozygous KRAS G13D allele, and not in DKO4 in which the mutant allele has been deleted by somatic recombination. We found that a ubiquitous binding partner of p190RhoGAP, p120RasGAP (RasGAP), is expressed in much lower levels in DKO4 cells compared to DLD1, and this expression is regulated by KRAS. Rescue of RasGAP expression in DKO4 rescued Rho pathway activation and partially rescued tumorigenicity in DKO4 cells, indicating that the combination of mutant KRAS and RasGAP expression is crucial to these phenotypes. We conclude that RasGAP is an important effector of mutant KRAS in CRC."

Global assessment of molecular changes caused by homozygous Pten deletion identified key genes known to be relevant to human prostate cancer, including those \"signature\" genes associated with human cancer metastasis. This murine prostate cancer model provides a unique tool for both exploring the molecular mechanism underlying prostate cancer and for development of new targeted therapies."

        "abstract": "Despite the existence of tumor-specific immune cells, most tumors have devised strategies to avoid immune attack. We demonstrate here that galectin-1 (Gal-1), a negative regulator of T cell activation and survival, plays a pivotal role in promoting escape from T cell-dependent immunity, thus conferring immune privilege to tumor cells. Blockade of immunosuppressive Gal-1 in vivo promotes tumor rejection and stimulates the generation of a tumor-specific T cell-mediated response in syngeneic mice, which are then able to resist subsequent challenge with wild-type Gal-1-sufficient tumors. Our data indicate that Gal-1 signaling in activated T cells constitutes an important mechanism of tumor-immune escape and that blockade of this inhibitory signal can allow for and potentiate effective immune responses against tumor cells, with profound implications for cancer immunotherapy."

Using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique the present study investigated the effect of the knockdown of BECLIN1 on the cell growth and proliferation of the A549 human lung cancer cell line. The target site for the RNAi technique was designed and the lentivirus vector for the small interfering (si)RNA expression was constructed according to the encoding sequence of the mRNA for BECLIN1. The A549\u00a0cells were transfected with the siRNA virus against BECLIN1. BECLIN1 expression was detected by reverse transcription (RT)\u2011PCR and western blot analysis. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was applied to detect cell growth. Flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis. The activity of caspase\u20113 and caspase\u20119 was also detected in the A549\u00a0cells with BECLIN1 knockdown. The results showed that siRNA virus transfection significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression of BECLIN1 in the transfected A549\u00a0cells. The knockdown of BECLIN1 promoted cell growth and decreased apoptosis. Caspase\u20113 and \u20119 activity in the A549\u00a0cells with BECLIN1 knockdown was significantly reduced. In conclusion, the siRNA expression vector effectively inhibited the expression of BECLIN1 in the A549 human lung cancer cell line\u00a0and promote the growth and proliferation of the A549\u00a0cells."

Using a lineage-tracing approach, we show that adult rodent prostate basal and luminal cells are independently self-sustained in vivo. Disrupting the tumor suppressor Pten in either lineage led to prostate cancer initiation. However, the cellular composition and onset dynamics of the resulting tumors are distinctive. Prostate luminal cells are more responsive to Pten null-induced mitogenic signaling. In contrast, basal cells are resistant to direct transformation. Instead, loss of Pten activity induces the capability of basal cells to differentiate into transformation-competent luminal cells. Our study suggests that deregulation of epithelial differentiation is a critical step for the initiation of prostate cancers of basal cell origin. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cancer cell lines are used extensively in various research. Knowledge of genetic alterations in these lines is important for understanding mechanisms underlying their biology. However, since paired normal tissues are usually unavailable for comparison, precisely determining genetic alterations in cancer cell lines is difficult. To address this issue, a highly efficient and reliable method is developed. Aims: Establishing a highly efficient and reliable experimental system for genetic profiling of cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A widely used breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, was genetically profiled with 4,396 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 11 whole chromosomes and two other small regions using a newly developed high-throughput multiplex genotyping approach. RESULTS: The fractions of homozygous SNPs in MCF-7 (13.3%) were significantly lower than those in the control cell line and in 24 normal human individuals (25.1% and 27.4%, respectively). Homozygous SNPs in MCF-7 were found in clusters. The sizes of these clusters were significantly larger than the expected based on random allelic combination. Fourteen such regions were found on chromosomes 1p, 1q, 2q, 6q, 13, 15q, 16q, 17q and 18p in MCF-7 and two in the small regions. CONCLUSIONS: These results are generally concordant with those obtained using different approaches but are better in defining their chromosomal positions. The used approach provides a reliable way to detecting possible genetic alterations in cancer cell lines without paired normal tissues."

Here we find that a lymphocyte lineage-restricted transcription factor, Aiolos, is frequently expressed in lung cancers and predicts markedly reduced patient survival. Aiolos decreases expression of a large set of adhesion-related genes, disrupting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Aiolos also reconfigures chromatin structure within the SHC1 gene, causing isoform-specific silencing of the anchorage reporter p66Shc and blocking anoikis invitro and invivo. In lung cancer tissues and single cells, p66Shc expression inversely correlates with that of Aiolos. Together, these findings suggest that Aiolos functions as an epigenetic driver of lymphocyte mimicry in metastatic epithelial cancers. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "The interleukin-mediated Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. Recently, increased STAT3 activity was found in hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple myeloma in which there was silencing of SOCS-1 (suppressor of cytokine signalling-1) by gene promoter hypermethylation. We investigated the expression level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and SOCS-1 in gastric cancer cell lines. Expression of SOCS-1 correlated with IL-6 level in most of the cell lines, except for AGS cells in which SOCS-1 was absent despite a high level of IL-6 production. Methylation analysis by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulphite sequencing revealed that CpG island of SOCS-1 was densely methylated in AGS cells. Demethylation treatment by 5'aza-deoxycytidine restored SOCS-1 expression and also suppressed constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in AGS cells. Moreover, methylation of SOCS-1 was detected in 27.5% (11 of 40) of primary gastric tumours samples, 10% (one of 10) of adjacent noncancer tissues but not in any (zero of nine) normal gastric mucosa. Methylation of SOCS-1 also correlated with the loss of mRNA expression in some primary gastric cancers. In conclusion, this is the first report to demonstrate that hypermethylation of SOCS-1 led to gene silencing in gastric cancer cell line and primary tumour samples. Downregulation of SOCS-1 cooperates with IL-6 in the activation of JAK/STAT pathway in gastric cancer."

        "abstract": "Loss of FHIT expression and p53 mutations are critical events in the early stages of lung carcinogenesis. The restoration of Fhit function in FHIT-negative cancer cells has been reported to cause tumour suppression by inhibition of cell proliferation and/or activation of apoptotic pathways. However, the studies designed to elucidate the biological role of Fhit and its potential interaction with p53 have produced conflicting results. We investigated here the effects of the simultaneous restoration of FHIT and p53 in Calu-1 cells by using a hormone-inducible gene expression system. We demonstrate that the restoration of FHIT expression reinforces the anti-proliferative effect associated with the simultaneous replacement of p53. Indeed, a more pronounced inhibition of cell proliferation associated with an earlier and higher induction of p21waf1 mRNA and protein expression was observed in Fhit/p53-expressing cells compared with cells expressing p53 alone. This effect was not due to Fhit-mediated up-regulation of p53 expression; in fact p53 protein was expressed at the same level in both FHIT-positive and FHIT-negative cell clones. Consistent with this result, Fhit did not affect the expression of MDM2, a protein known to interact directly with p53 and target p53 for proteolytic degradation, thus down-regulating its activity. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Hadrontherapy is a form of external radiation therapy, which uses beams of charged particles such as carbon ions. Compared to conventional radiotherapy with photons, the main advantage of carbon ion therapy is the precise dose localization along with an increased biological effectiveness. The first results obtained from prostate cancer patients treated with carbon ion therapy showed good local tumor control and survival rates. In view of this advanced treatment modality we investigated the effects of irradiation with different beam qualities on gene expression changes in the PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. For this purpose, PC3 cells were irradiated with various doses (0.0, 0.5 and 2.0 Gy) of carbon ions (LET=33.7 keV/\u00b5m) at the beam of the Grand Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur National d'Ions Lourds (Caen, France). Comparative experiments with X-rays were performed at the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre. Genome-wide gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. Our results show a downregulation in many genes involved in cell cycle and cell organization processes after 2.0 Gy irradiation. This effect was more pronounced after carbon ion irradiation compared with X-rays. Furthermore, we found a significant downregulation of many genes related to cell motility. Several of these changes were confirmed using qPCR. In addition, recurrence-free survival analysis of prostate cancer patients based on one of these motility genes (FN1) revealed that patients with low expression levels had a prolonged recurrence-free survival time, indicating that this gene may be a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Understanding how different radiation qualities affect the cellular behavior of prostate cancer cells is important to improve the clinical outcome of cancer radiation therapy."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease in women in the western world. Tamoxifen has been the standard first line endocrine therapy for patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors. Unfortunately, almost all patients with advanced disease develop tamoxifen resistance. This has lead to a search for new potent antiestrogens. One of the new compounds under development is the pure antiestrogen RU 58,668. To study the mechanisms behind acquired resistance to RU 58,668, the RU 58,668-resistant cell line MCF-7/RU58(R)-1 (RU58(R)-1) was developed. The RU58(R)-1 cell line was responsive to tamoxifen, but cross-resistant to ICI 182,780 and the estrogen-sensitivity was reduced compared to the parental MCF-7 cell line. The protein levels of ERalpha, IGF-I Receptor (IGF-IR) and Bcl-2 were severely reduced, when RU58(R)-1 cells were cultured with RU 58,668 and the expression of progesterone receptor (PR) was lost. The ERalpha level increased upon withdrawal of RU 58,668 and the ERalpha protein was destabilized by RU 58,668 in both cell lines. Regulation of most of the investigated estrogen-sensitive mRNAs was found to be normal in the resistant cells. The protein levels of IGF-IR, Bcl-2 and the IGF Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP2) reverted towards MCF-7 levels upon RU 58,668 withdrawal, but the resistant phenotype was maintained. Thus, it appears as acquired resistance to RU 58,668 is not a result of loss of the ERalpha expression or function and we suggest that in the presence of RU 58,668, the RU58(R)-1 cell line probably uses other mitogenic pathways than the ERalpha pathway for growth and survival."

        "abstract": "A large-scale RNA interference screen to discover genes involved in trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer identified only PTEN as a modulator of drug sensitivity. Oncogenic mutants of PIK3CA (activator of the same pathway and frequently mutated in breast cancer) also conferred resistance to trastuzumab in cell culture. In a cohort of 55 breast cancer patients, activation of the PI3K pathway, as judged by the presence of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations or low PTEN expression, was associated with poor prognosis after trastuzumab therapy, and the combined analysis of PTEN and PIK3CA identified twice as many patients at increased risk for progression compared to PTEN alone. Thus, assessment of PI3K pathway activation may provide a biomarker to identify patients unlikely to respond to trastuzumab-based therapy."

On this trajectory of genomic progression, we identified a subpopulation of patients with very early HER2 amplification.

        "abstract": "Today, attempt to the preparation of stable drug with high drug delivery efficiency is inevitable. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), with hydrophobic structure obtained from the herb of Curcuma longa, have various applications in cancer therapy. But, its low water solubility and bioavailability is possible for poor drug delivery of curcumin. In this study, we prepared beta-cyclodextrin-curcumin complex to determine the inhibitory effect of this drug on telomerase gene expression. Curcumin was encapsulated into cyclodextrin and the rate of curcumin loading was estimated. Cytotoxic effects of beta-cyclodextrin curcumin were investigated by colorimetric cell viability (MTT) assay. Then inhibition of telomerase gene expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MTT assay demonstrated that beta-cyclodextrin have no cytotoxic effect on its own. Also, it showed dose-dependency and time-dependency for beta-cyclodextrin -curcumin on T47D cell line. Expression of telomerase gene in cells effectively was reduced as the concentration of beta-cyclodextrin -curcumin complex was increased. The results show that beta-cyclodextrin -curcumin complex have cytotoxic effect on T47D cell line through down regulation of telomerase expression and induction apoptosis by enhancing curcumin uptake by cells. So, beta-cyclodextrin could be good carrier for these kinds of hydrophobic agents."

ETS gene-mediated transcription and cell invasion require PARP1 and DNA-PKcs expression and activity. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 inhibits ETS-positive, but not ETS-negative, prostate cancer xenograft growth. Finally, overexpression of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion induces DNA damage, which is potentiated by PARP1 inhibition in a manner similar to that of BRCA1/2 deficiency. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc."

We used molecular profiling combined with functional assays to investigate the role of these cells in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Blood monocytes from RCC patients displayed a tumor-promoting transcriptional profile that supported functions like angiogenesis and invasion. Induction of this protumor phenotype required an interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-dependent mechanism. Indeed, targeting of IL-1-IL-1R axis in a human RCC xenograft model abrogated the protumor phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and reduced tumor growth in vivo. Supporting this, meta-analysis of gene expression from human RCC tumors showed IL1B expression to correlate with myelomonocytic markers, protumor genes, and tumor staging. Analyzing RCC patient tumors confirmed the protumor phenotype of TAMs. These data provide direct evidence for a tumor-promoting role of monocytes and macrophages in human cancer and indicate IL-1-IL-1R as a possible therapeutic target."

Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ca2+ store depletion by itself is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells, and that sustained Ca2+ entry via activated store-operated channels (SOCs) is required as well. Our data therefore suggest the pivotal role of SOCs in apoptosis and cancer progression. Copyright ?? 2002 Cell Press."

Here we report a mechanism by which Twist recruits BRD4 to direct WNT5A expression in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Twist contains a \"histone H4-mimic\" GK-X-GK motif that is diacetylated by Tip60. The diacetylated Twist binds the second bromodomain of BRD4, whose first bromodomain interacts with acetylated H4, thereby constructing an activated Twist/BRD4/P-TEFb/RNA-Pol II complex at the WNT5A promoter and enhancer. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Twist-BRD4 association reduced WNT5A expression and suppressed invasion, cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties, and tumorigenicity of BLBC cells.

B55??-associated PP2A interacts with PDK1 and modulates its activity toward Myc phosphorylation. On loss of PPP2R2B, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin triggers a compensatory Myc phosphorylation in PDK1-dependent, but PI3K and AKT-independent manner, resulting in resistance. Reexpression of PPP2R2B, genetic ablation of PDK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 abrogates the rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation, leading to rapamycin sensitization.

Across multiple mouse tumor models and human tumor biopsies, we have delineated the intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) populations as distinct from macrophage populations. Within these, CD103+ DCs are extremely sparse and yet remarkably capable CTL stimulators. These are uniquely dependent on IRF8, Zbtb46, and Batf3 transcription factors and are generated by GM-CSF and FTL3L cytokines. Regressing tumors have higher proportions of these cells, T-cell-dependent immune clearance relies on them, and abundance of their transcripts in human tumors correlates with clinical outcome.

We find that the mutations activate the kinase by disrupting autoinhibitory interactions, and that they accelerate catalysis as much as 50-fold in vitro. Structures of inhibitors in complex with both wild-type and mutant kinases reveal similar binding modes for gefitinib and AEE788, but a marked rotation of the staurosporine in the G719S mutant.

In a time-course study, chemiluminescence of MCLA (C-MCLA) showed a peak level at 10 min and a background level at 60 min after the addition of DDP. The intensity of C-MCLA increased with increasing concentrations of DDP or MCLA in a limited concentration range, and was significantly correlated (r = 0.960) with the number of A2780 cells. DDP-induced C-MCLA was completely inhibited by the addition of the O2- scavenger, superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, SOD did not decrease DDP cytotoxicity in terms of clonogenic cell survival.

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) regulates the expression of genes supporting breast cancer cells in bone, but little is known about prostate cancer bone metastases and TGF-\u03b2. Our study reveals that the TGFBR1 inhibitor SD208 effectively reduces prostate cancer bone metastases. TGF-\u03b2 upregulates in prostate cancer cells a set of genes associated with cancer aggressiveness and bone metastases, and the most upregulated gene was PMEPA1. In patients, PMEPA1 expression decreased in metastatic prostate cancer and low Pmepa1 correlated with decreased metastasis-free survival. Only membrane-anchored isoforms of PMEPA1 interacted with R-SMADs and ubiquitin ligases, blocking TGF-\u03b2 signaling independently of the proteasome. Interrupting this negative feedback loop by PMEPA1 knockdown increased prometastatic gene expression and bone metastases in a mouse prostate cancer model."

        "abstract": "The synergistic effect of combination treatment with COX-2 inhibitors and chemotherapy may be another promising therapy regimen in the future treatment of colorectal cancer. Curcumin, a major yellow pigment in turmeric which is used widely allover the world, inhibits the growth of human colon cancer cell line HT-29 significantly and specifically inhibits the expression of COX-2 protein. However, the worldwide exposure of populations to curcumin raised the question of whether this agent would enhance or inhibit the effects of chemotherapy. In this report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effect of curcumin and a traditional chemotherapy agent, 5-FU, against the proliferation of a human colon cancer cell line (HT-29). The combination effect was quantitatively determined using the method of median-effect principle and the combination index. The inhibition of COX-2 expression after treatment with the curcumin-5-FU combination was also evaluated by Western blot analysis. The IC50 value in the HT-29 cells for curcumin was 15.9 +/- 1.96 mu M and for 5-FU it was 17.3 +/- 1.85 mu M. When curcumin and 5-FU were used concurrently, synergistic inhibition of growth was quantitatively demonstrated. The level of COX-2 protein expression was reduced almost 6-fold after the combination treatment. Our results demonstrate synergism between curcumin and 5-FU at higher doses against the human colon cancer cell line HT-29. This synergism was associated with the decreased expression of COX-2 protein. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel."

The DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) technique was used to generate fingerprint profiles of a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) and a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). When compared with one another, a polymorphic biomarker gene (262 base pairs (bps)) was identified in MCF-10A but was not present in MCF-7. This gene was cloned from the genomic DNA of the MCF-10A cell line, and subjected to Genbank database analysis. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence polymorphic marker (Genbank account: AC079630) shows that this biomarker has 100% homology with the nucleotide sequence of human chromosome 12 BAC RP11-476D10 (bps 19612-19353). The nucleotide sequence was used for possible protein translation product and the result obtained indicated that the gene codes for hypothetical protein XF2620. In order to evaluate the effects that the 262 bps biomarker would have on the morphology of MCF-7 cells, it was transfected into MCF-7 cells. There were observable changes in the morphology of the transfected cells. These changes included an increase in cell elongation and a decrease in cell aggregation."

Using next generation sequencing, we assembled the structural variations in VCaP genomic DNA and observed a massive number of genomic rearrangements along the q arm of chromosome 5, characteristic of chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is a recently recognized phenomenon characterized by extensive chromosomal shattering in a single catastrophic event, mainly detected in cancer cells. Various structural events identified on chromosome 5q of VCaP resulted in gene fusions. Out of the 18 gene fusion candidates tested, 15 were confirmed on genomic level. In our set of gene fusions, only rarely we observe microhomology flanking the breakpoints. On RNA level, only five transcripts were detected and NDUFAF2-MAST4 was the only resulting in an in-frame fusion transcript. Our data indicate that although a marker of genomic instability, chromothripsis might lead to only a limited number of functionally relevant fusion genes."

        "abstract": "Recent research has suggested that certain plant-derived polyphenols, i.e., ursolic acid (UA), which are reported to have antitumor activities, might be used to sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy by inhibiting pathways leading to radiation therapy resistance. This experiment was designed to investigate the effects and possible mechanism of radiosensitization by UA in BGC-823 cell line from human adenocarcinoma gastric cancer in vitro. UA caused cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, and we used a sub-cytotoxicity concentration of UA to test radioenhancement efficacy with UA in gastric cancer. Radiosensitivity was determined by clonogenic survival assay. Surviving fraction of the combined group with irradiation and sub-cytotoxicity UA significantly decreased compared with the irradiation group. The improved radiosensitization efficacy was associated with enhanced G2/M arrest, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), down-regulated Ki-67 level and improved apoptosis. In conclusion, as UA demonstrated potent antiproliferation effect and synergistic effect, it could be used as a potential drug sensitizer for the application of radiotherapy."

        "abstract": "Osteopontin (OPN) is a highly hydrophilic and negatively charged sialoprotein of approximately 298 amino acids which is an important mediator of tumor metastatic behavior. We have previously demonstrated that endotoxin-dependent OPN gene transcription is regulated by a constitutive transcriptional repressor protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (hnRNP-A/B). However, in the context of cancer, the role of hnRNP-A/B in the transcriptional regulation of OPN and its metastasis-promoting functions has not been previously studied. We examined hnRNP-A/B in the 4T1 murine mammary epithelial tumor cell line, a thioguanine resistant subline which closely mimics stage IV breast cancer in humans. Our data indicate that hnRNP-A/B p37 binds to the OPN promoter, significantly decreases OPN promoter activity and mRNA levels, ablates OPN protein expression, and inhibits OPN dependent in vitro correlates of metastatic behavior, motility, and invasion. These results are unique and may suggest new therapies to re-establish loco-regional control of cancers."

Overexpression of miR-105 in nonmetastatic cancer cells induces metastasis and vascular permeability in distant organs, whereas inhibition of miR-105 in highly metastatic tumors alleviates these effects. miR-105 can be detected in the circulation at the premetastatic stage, and its levels in the blood and tumor are associated with ZO-1 expression and metastatic progression in early-stage breast cancer. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc."

A recent outcome of whole exome sequencing of thousands of human cancers has been the unexpected discovery of many inactivating mutations in genes that control the epigenome. These mutations have the potential to disrupt DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, and nucleosome positioning and hence, gene expression. Genetic alteration of the epigenome therefore contributes to cancer just as epigenetic process can cause point mutations and disable DNA repair functions.

Here, we show that LDH-A is acetylated at lysine 5 (K5) and that this acetylation inhibits LDH-A activity. Furthermore, the K5-acetylated LDH-A is recognized by the HSC70 chaperone and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Replacement of endogenous LDH-A with an acetylation mimetic mutant decreases cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, K5 acetylation of LDH-A is reduced in human pancreatic cancers.

        "abstract": "The inflammatory response\u2014characterized by release of cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1b and infiltration of infected or injured tissue by macrophages and neutrophils\u2014is the first line of defense against infection by pathogens. Although an early inflammatory response is beneficial in stemming the tide of infection, a prolonged response may result in severe illness or even death. For example, the 1918 Spanish influenza virus was lethal because it triggered a ''cytokine storm'' that resulted in severe lung damage. An inappropriate and prolonged inflammatory response to normal nonpathogenic gut bacteria is a cause of Crohn's disease. Meanwhile, insidious low-level inflammation in the tumor microenvironment aids and abets tumor cells in their quest to become metastatic. Understanding the triggers of inflammation and the signaling pathways involved in cytokine production and immune cell mobilization will be essential for developing thera-peutics to treat diseases caused by a runaway inflammatory response. Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment\u2014characterized by the infiltration of macrophages and the release of proinflam-matory cytokines such as TNFa\u2014is a powerful driver of tumor formation and metastasis. The ability of tumor cells to detach from their microenvironment and migrate to other locations is reminiscent of the change that takes place during embryogen-esis when epithelial cells become more fibroblast-like and start to migrate. This process, termed the epithelial-to-mesen-chymal transition (EMT), is characterized by loss of expression of a surface marker called E-cadherin that enables cells to adhere to the substratum. The transcription factor Snail is responsible for repressing expression of E-cadherin. Reporting in Cancer Cell, Wu et al. (2009) now pinpoint Snail as a principal culprit in the inflammation-driven metastasis of tumor cells. They discovered that the normally labile Snail protein becomes stabilized in response to TNFa released by macrophages loi-tering at the invasive edge of epithelial tumors. The stable Snail protein then switches on genes required for instigation of the EMT program, enabling epithelial tumors to acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype that facilitates their detachment and migration into the circulation. Snail is normally phosphorylated by GSK3b and is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, but how does Snail become stabilized? The authors show that TNFa switches on expression of the master transcription factor NF-kB, which then activates a gene encoding CSN2, a component of the COP9 signaling complex (signal-osome) that regulates ubiquitin ligases. The authors speculate that Snail may bind to the signalosome shielding itself from phosphorylation or that it may be deubiquitinated by this complex thus avoiding degradation. To test their model, the authors blocked expression of Snail in breast tumor cells; they then injected these cells into the tail vein of SCID mice treated with lipopolysaccharide to induce an inflammatory response. They found that the number of breast tumor metastases in the lung was greatly decreased when Snail expression was blocked. These new findings strengthen the connection between inflammation and tumor metastasis and pinpoint CSN as a potential new target for anticancer drug development."

        "title": "Evaluation of hypoxia inducible factor 1-Alpha (HIF1A) after treatment with melatonin in breast cancer cell line",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Breast cancer can cause death in patients due to tumor growth and metastasis development. The hypoxia could limit tumor angiogenesis preventing its growth and progression however, tumor cells induce the transcription of HIF1A that promotes angiogenesis. Several researches focus on developing new therapeutic agents to inhibit angiogenesis factors, such as melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland. The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in HIF1A protein expression in breast cancer cell line, after the induction of hypoxia and treatment with melatonin. Material and Method: MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in DMEM (high glucose) and incubated at 37(degrees)C in 5% CO2. At first, the cells were divided into 7 groups to measure the cell viability by MTT assay: Group I: no treatment (Control), Group II received 100 (mu)M of CoCl2 to hypoxia, and Groups III to VII also received CoCl2 and different concentrations of melatonin (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM) for 24 hours. Once established the optimal concentration of melatonin, the cells were divided in 3 groups to assess the expression of HIF1A by immunocytochemistry and Real-Time PCR: Group A (control), Group B with only CoCl2 and Group III with CoCl2 and 1mM of melatonin. The quantification of immunoexpression was performed by optical densitometry (ImageJ software), demonstrating mean optical density (MOD). The results were compared by ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni test. Results and Discussion: The results showed that all groups treated with melatonin under hypoxia conditions had reduced cell viability. The concentration of 1mM showed decrease of 48.13%, being considered the optimal concentration of melatonin for treatment in vitro. By immunocytochemistry, there was significant difference between the HIF1A expression in all groups (p < 0001). The expression of HIF1A was lower in the control group (MOD = 114.2) when compared to the other groups (p Conclusion: Our results suggest that melatonin is effective in control tumor angiogenesis and can be a possible therapeutic alternative for breast cancer."

        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their anticancer effects through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent and independent mechanisms. Here, we report that Sulindac, an NSAID, induces apoptosis by binding to retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha). We identified an N-terminally truncated RXRalpha (tRXRalpha) in several cancer cell lines and primary tumors, which interacted with the p85alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) promoted tRXRalpha interaction with the p85alpha, activating PI3K/AKT signaling. When combined with TNFalpha, Sulindac inhibited TNFalpha-induced tRXRalpha/p85alpha interaction, leading to activation of the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. We designed and synthesized a Sulindac analog K-80003, which has increased affinity to RXRalpha but lacks COX inhibitory activity. K-80003 displayed enhanced efficacy in inhibiting tRXRalpha-dependent AKT activation and tRXRalpha tumor growth in animals."

        "abstract": "pRb and p53 are two major tumor suppressors. Here, we found that p53 activates expression of Pirh2 and KPC1, two of the three ubiquitin ligases for p27. Loss of p53 in the absence of Skp2, the third ubiquitin ligase for p27, shrinks the cellular pool of p27 ubiquitin ligases to accumulate p27 protein. In the absence of pRb and p53, p27 was unable to inhibit DNA synthesis in spite of its abundance, but could inhibit division of cells that maintain DNA replication with rereplication. This mechanism blocked pRb/p53 doubly deficient pituitary and prostate tumorigenesis lastingly coexistent with bromodeoxyuridine-labeling neoplastic lesions, revealing an unconventional cancer cell vulnerability when pRb and p53 are inactivated. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc."

These phenotypic subtypes segregate with largely unique genetic lesions, suggesting the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms. In this report, we show that the BLIMP1/PRDM1 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including homozygous deletions, truncating or missense mutations, and transcriptional repression by constitutively active BCL6, in ~53% of ABC-DLBCL. In vivo, conditional deletion of Blimp1 in mouse B cells promotes the development of lymphoproliferative disorders recapitulating critical features of the human ABC-DLBCL. These results demonstrate that BLIMP1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene whose loss contributes to lymphomagenesis by blocking plasma cell differentiation."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: nm23-H1, a tumor metastasis suppressive gene, can reverse tumor metastasis phenotype. But the molecular mechanism of nm23-H1 in inhibiting or reversing metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. This study was to explore the molecular mechanism of nm23-H1 in reversing metastasis phenotype of lung cancer. METHODS: nm23-H1 gene and pLXSN were separately transfected into human lung cancer cell line L9981. Proliferation of L9981, L9981-pLXSN, and L9981-nm23-H1 cells was detected by MTT assay, cell invasive ability was detected by modified Boyden chamber. Tumorigenesis and experimental lung metastasis were determined in vivo. mRNA and protein levels of beta-catenin, E-Cadherin, CD44S, CD44V6, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: (1)Cell proliferation, clone formation, and invasive ability were significantly lower in L9981-nm23-H1 cells than in L9981 cells [(19.5+/-2.9)% vs. 100%, 10.3+/-0.7 vs. 21.7+/-1.3, 31.0+/-3.0 vs. 151.0+/-6.3, P<0.01]. (2) The inhibitory rate of tumorigenesis of nude mice was significantly higher in L8891-nm23-H1 group than in L9981 group (85.6% vs. 0%, P<0.001)u the lung metastatic rate was significantly lower in L9981-nm23-H1 group than in L9981 group (0% vs. 100%, P<0.001). (3)nm23-H1 up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of beta-catenin, E-Cadherin, and TIMP-1, and down-regulated levels of MMP-2, CD44V6, and VEGF (P<0.01). (4) nm23-H1 up-regulated mRNA level of CD44s, protein level of CD44s didn't change (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: nm23-H1 gene can reverse malignant and metastatic phenotype of L9981 cells through regulating the expressions of lung cancer metastasis-related genes."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kinesin spindle proteins (KSP) are motor proteins that play an essential role in mitotic spindle formation. HsEg5, a KSP, is responsible for the formation of the bipolar spindle, which is critical for proper cell division during mitosis. The function of HsEg5 provides a novel target for the manipulation of the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. SB715992, an experimental KSP inhibitor, has been shown to perturb bipolar spindle formation, thus making it an excellent candidate for anti-cancer agent. Our major objective was a) to investigate the cell growth inhibitory effects of SB715992 on PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line, b) to investigate whether the growth inhibitory effects of SB715992 could be enhanced when combined with genistein, a naturally occurring isoflavone and, c) to determine gene expression profile to establish molecular mechanism of action of SB715992.\\n\\nMETHODS: PC-3 cells were treated with varying concentration of SB715992, 30 microM of genistein, and SB715992 plus 30 microM of genistein. After treatments, PC-3 cells were assayed for cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and alteration in gene and protein expression using cell inhibition assay, apoptosis assay, microarray analysis, real-time RT-PCR, and Western Blot analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: SB715992 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. SB715992 was found to regulate the expression of genes related to the control of cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell signaling pathways, and apoptosis. In addition, our results showed that combination treatment with SB715992 and genistein caused significantly greater cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis compared to the effects of either agent alone.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our results clearly show that SB715992 is a potent anti-tumor agent whose therapeutic effects could be enhanced by genistein. Hence, we believe that SB715992 could be a novel agent for the treatment of prostate cancer with greater success when combined with a non-toxic natural agent like genistein."

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that substance P (SP) induces cell proliferation and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists inhibit growth in several human cancer cell lines, but it is currently unknown whether such actions are exerted on human laryngeal carcinoma cell line HEp-2. In addition, the presence of NK-1 receptor has not been demonstrated in this cell line. We carried out an in vitro study of the growth inhibitory capacity of the NK-1 receptor antagonists L-733,060 and L-732,138 against human laryngeal carcinoma cell line HEp-2. Coulter counter was used to determine viable cell numbers followed by application of the tetrazolium compound MTS. Furthermore, an immunoblot analysis was used to determine the NK-1 receptor, and the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) method was applied to demonstrate apoptosis of the laryngeal carcinoma cells. We observed the presence of several NK-1 receptors isoforms (34, 46, 58 and 75 kDa). Nanomolar concentrations of SP increased the growth rate of the cell line and micromolar concentrations of L-733,060 and L-732,138 inhibited the growth of the HEp-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with and without previous administration of SP. The 50% inhibition concentration values were 21.34 microM and 37.97 (48 h) respectively for HEp-2. NK-1 receptor presence on HEp-2 cells was confirmed by western blotting. DAPI staining revealed the presence of apoptosis following NK-1 receptor antagonists treatment. We demonstrated that NK-1 receptors were present in this laryngeal cancer cell line; these findings demonstrate that SP acts as a mitogen on the human laryngeal carcinoma cell line HEp-2 through the NK-1 receptor, and also indicate that both NK-1 receptors antagonists induced apoptosis of the tumour cells. This new action, reported here for the first time, suggests that the NK-1 receptor is a new and promising target in the treatment of human laryngeal carcinoma."

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ATP7B antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODNs) on regulating the sensitivity to cisplatin in ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3ip1. The ATP7B ASODNs and the corresponding sense oligodeoxynucleotide (SODN) as control were transfected into SKOV3ip1 cells by lipofectamine-2000. The changes of ATP7B were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. The survival rate of the SKOV3ip1 cells was assessed by MTT assay. Compared with nontransfected cell, the transfer of ASODN/lipofectin (LF) into SKOV3ip1 cells resulted in (1) 73.70% and 48.30% reduction of ATP7B in messenger RNA and protein, respectively, (2) an obviously decreased intracellular fluorescence intensity from 79.42 to 50.87 (P < 0.01), and (3) a decreased IC(50) value for cisplatin from 126.63 to 80.90 micromol/L (P < 0.01), while no significant changes were detected for groups treated with SODN/LF and LF only. ASODN transfection can inhibit the expression of ATP7B and increase the cisplatin sensitivity in SKOV3ip1 cells."

        "abstract": "REGb cell line, a highly immunogenic tumor cell variant isolated from a rat colon cancer, yields regressive tumors when injected into syngeneic hosts. We previously demonstrated that REGb tumor immunogenicity was related to the capacity of releasing dead cells in vivo. Also, in vitro, REGb cell monolayers release dead cells, especially when cultured in serum-free medium. In the current study, we show that the release of dead cells results from an atypical death process associating features of necrosis and apoptosis. In spite of features considered as hallmarks of caspase-dependent apoptosis, including chromatin fragmentation and DNA oligonucleosomal cleavage, caspases are not activated and caspase inhibitors are ineffective to prevent REGb cell death. In contrast with a number of other types of cell death, the spontaneous death of REGb cells in culture depends on de novo protein synthesis as this death is blocked by low doses of the mRNA translation inhibitor cycloheximide. This unusual mode of cell death that associates necrotic and apoptotic features could provide optimal conditions for triggering a specific immune response."

One tumor class displaying neuronal lineage markers shows longer survival, while two tumor classes enriched for neural stem cell markers display equally short survival. Poor prognosis subclasses exhibit markers either of proliferation or of angiogenesis and mesenchyme. Upon recurrence, tumors frequently shift toward the mesenchymal subclass. Chromosomal locations of genes distinguishing tumor subclass parallel DNA copy number differences between subclasses. Functional relevance of tumor subtype molecular signatures is suggested by the ability of cell line signatures to predict neurosphere growth.

        "abstract": "The human breast cancer cell line, estrogen receptor negative, MDA-MB231, was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of polyphenolic extracts from the edible part of artichokes (AEs). Treatment of cancer cells reduced cell viability and inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, AEs did not have any effect on normal breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Chlorogenic acid (ChA), the most representative component of the polyphenolic fraction of artichoke, had no prominent effects on the cell death rate of MDA-MB231 cells. The addition of AEs to the cells, rather than ChA, triggered apoptosis via a mitochondrial and a death-receptor pathway, as shown by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-8, respectively. Furthermore, an increase of the Bax:Bcl2 ratio and up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1, crucial apoptotic players, were documented. According to our data on activation of caspase-9, a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (?m) was shown. Cell motility and invasion capabilities were remarkably inhibited by AEs-treatment in highly invasive MDA-MB231 cells. In addition, a significant decrease of proteolytic activity of metalloproteinase-2 protein (MMP-2), involved in degrading components of the extracellular matrix, was detected. Our findings indicate that AEs reduced cell viability, inhibited cell growth, triggered apoptotic mechanisms, and showed inhibitory properties against the invasive behavior of MDA-MB231 cancer cell line. Altogether, these data indicate the potential chemopreventive activity of artichoke polyphenolic extracts. J. Cell. Physiol. 227: 33013309, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

These tumors predominantly exhibit functional inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele, implicating FH inactivation as a tumor-promoting event. Hypoxia-inducible factors are expressed in many cancers and are increased in clear cell renal carcinomas. Under normoxia, the HIFs are labile due to VHL-dependent proteasomal degradation, but stabilization occurs under hypoxia due to inactivation of HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HPH), which prevents HIF hydroxylation and VHL recognition. We demonstrate that FH inhibition, together with elevated intracellular fumarate, coincides with HIF upregulation. Further, we show that fumarate acts as a competitive inhibitor of HPH.

We report that mutp53 prolongs TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in cultured cells and intestinal organoid cultures. Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium, mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-kappaB activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC).

ErbB2 and 14-3-3?? overexpression, respectively, increased cell migration and decreased cell adhesion, two prerequisites of tumor cell invasion. 14-3-3?? overexpression reduced cell adhesion by activating the TGF-??/Smads pathway that led to ZFHX1B/SIP-1 upregulation, E-cadherin loss, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Recent evidence suggests a subset of cells within a tumor with \"stem-like\" characteristics. These cells are able to transplant tumors in immunodeficient hosts. Distinct from non-malignant stem cells, cancer stem cells (CSC) show low proliferative rates, high self-renewing capacity, propensity to differentiate into actively proliferating tumor cells, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiation. They are often characterized by elevated expression of stem cell surface markers, in particular CD133, and sets of differentially expressed stem cell-associated genes. CSC are usually rare in clinical specimens and hardly amenable to functional studies and gene expression profiling. In this study, a panel of heterogenous melanoma cell lines was screened for typical CSC features.METHODS:Nine heterogeneous metastatic melanoma cell lines including D10 and WM115 were studied. Cell lines were phenotyped using flow cytometry and clonogenic assays were performed by limiting dilution analysis on magnetically sorted cells. Spheroidal growth was investigated in pretreated flasks. Gene expression profiles were assessed by using real-time rt-PCR and DNA microarrays. Magnetically sorted tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of immunodeficient mice. Comparative immunohistochemistry was performed on xenografts and primary human melanoma sections.RESULTS:D10 cells expressed CD133 with a significantly higher clonogenic capacity as compared to CD133- cells. Na8, D10, and HBL cells formed spheroids on poly-HEMA-coated flasks. D10, Me39, RE, and WM115 cells expressed at least 2 of the 3 regulatory core transcription factors SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4 involved in the maintenance of stemness in mesenchymal stem cells. Gene expression profiling on CD133+ and CD133- D10 cells revealed 68 up- and 47 downregulated genes (+/-1.3 fold). Two genes, MGP and PROM1 (CD133), were outstandingly upregulated. CD133+ D10 cells formed tumors in NSG mice contrary to CD133- cells and CD133 expression was detected in xenografts and primary human melanoma sections using immunohistochemistry.CONCLUSIONS:Established melanoma cell lines exhibit, to variable extents, the typical features of CSCs. The tumorigenic cell line D10, expressing CD133 and growing in spheroids and might qualify as a potential model of melanoma CSCs."

Our aim was to find the relationship between miRNAs and arsenic trioxide treatment by using T24 human bladder carcinoma cells. By performing microRNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR after ATO treatment, we found that expression levels of several miRNAs, in particular, miRNA-19a, were significantly decreased in T24 cell line. Furthermore, cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry analysis, prediction of miRNA targets, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter assay were performed to determine the role of mir-19a in affecting the biological behaviors of T24 cells. Several miRNAs were up-regulated or down-regulated in T24 cells treated with arsenic trioxide compared to their controls. If only changes above two folds were considered, two miRNAs were identified, miRNA-19a was down-regulated, while miRNA-222* was up-regulated. Among them, knockdown of miRNA-19a by anti-miRNA-19a transfection showed a positive therapeutic effect in bladder cancer cells by inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell apoptosis targeting PTEN through the PTEN/Akt pathway. Besides this, a synergy effect was detected between knockdown of miRNA-19a and arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide altered miRNA expression profile in T24 cells. It seems miRNA-19a plays a critical role in the mechanism of arsenic trioxide treatment in bladder cancer. The synergy effect between miRNA-19a and arsenic trioxide that advocates targeting the mir-19a may represent a potential approach to enhance the efficacy and safety of ATO to treat bladder cancer by a decrease in dose."

Repressed NF-??B activity is found in human colon cancer cells in which ??-catenin is activated. Importantly, activated ??-catenin was found to inhibit the expression of NF-??B target genes, including Fas and TRAF1. Furthermore, a strong inverse correlation was identified between the expression levels of ??-catenin and Fas in colon and breast tumor tissues, suggesting that ??-catenin regulates NF-??B and its targets in vivo.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a well-known factor risk for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Circulating leptin levels are increased in obese and it has been suggested to play an important role in mammary tumor formation and progression. To contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying leptin action in breast cancer, our aim was to identify proteins regulated by leptin in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. METHODS: We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify proteins affected by leptin. RESULTS: Thirty proteins were found differentially expressed in MCF-7 cells after 48 h leptin exposure. Proteins regulated by leptin included proteins previously implicated in breast cancer such as catechol-o-methyltransferase, cathepsin D, hsp27, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase and regulatory proteins of the Ras signaling pathway. Proteins involved in other cellular functions such as stress response, cytosqueleton remodeling and proteins belonging to ubiquitin-proteasome system, were also identified. Furthermore, leptin-treated cells showed a substantial uptake of the serum carrier proteins albumin and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: This screening reveals that leptin influences the levels of key proteins involved in breast cancer which opens new avenues for the study of the molecular mechanisms linking obesity to breast cancer."

Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation were used to confirm the interaction complex.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 72 RKIP-interacting proteins were identified by MS/MS. Those proteins play roles in enzyme metabolism, molecular chaperoning, biological oxidation, cytoskeleton organization, signal transduction, and enzymolysis. Three RKIP-interaction protein network diagrams were constructed with Michigan Molecular Interactions, functional linage network, and Predictome analysis to address the molecular pathways of the functional activity of RKIP. The MS/MS-characterized components of the existing interaction complex (RKIP, HSP90, 14-3-3\u03b5, and keratin 8) were confirmed by Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study is the first discovery of the interaction of RKIP with HSP90, 14-3-3, and keratin.

Gene promoters within LREA domains are characterized by a gain of active chromatin marks and a loss of repressive marks. Notably, although promoter hypomethylation is uncommon, we show that extensive DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands or \" CpG-island borders\" is strongly related to cancer-specific gene activation or differential promoter usage.

However, there are few experimental studies supporting this treatment. AIM OF THE STUDY: To examine the radiosensitivity of human pancreatic cancer cells and its modulation by 5-FU. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1 and NP-18 cells growing as monolayer culture were treated with radiation and 5-FU. In addition, 5-FU was studied administered either pre- or postradiation, both as pulse or continuous exposure. Cell survival was determined by the in vitro clonogenic assay. RESULTS: In MiaPaCa-2 cell line, both radiation and 5-FU alone reduced cell survival. The addition of 5-FU to radiation caused a significant net decrease of cell survival. Pulse exposure of 5-FU decreased survival after 2 Gy and mean inactivation dose by 1.64; continuous exposure decreased survival after 2 Gy and mean inactivation dose by about 2.4. Timing of 5-FU exposure did not modify survival. However, when adjusting for 5-FU killing effect and cell multiplicity, only continuous exposure significantly enhanced radiation cell killing. CONCLUSION: Both pulse and continuous exposure increase radiation cell killing, but only continuous exposure may radiosensitize MiaPaCa-2 cells."

We used experimental models and clinical databases to identify GATA2 as a regulator of chemotherapy resistance and tumorigenicity in this context. Mechanistically, direct upregulation of the growth hormone IGF2 emerged as a mediator of the aggressive properties regulated byGATA2. IGF2 in turn activated IGF1R and INSR as well as a downstream polykinase program. The characterization of this axis prompted a combination strategy whereby dual IGF1R/INSR inhibition restored the efficacy of chemotherapy and improved survival in preclinical models. These studies reveal a GATA2-IGF2 aggressiveness axis in lethal prostate cancer and identify a therapeutic opportunity in this challenging disease."

Inhibition of p73 function by dominant-negative proteins or by mutant p53 abrogates apoptosis and cytotoxicity induced by these agents. A polymorphism encoding either arginine (72R) or proline (72P) at codon 72 of p53 influences inhibition of p73 by a range of p53 mutants identified in squamous cancers. Clinical response following cisplatin-based chemo-radiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer is influenced by this polymorphism, cancers expressing 72R mutants having lower response rates than those expressing 72P mutants. Polymorphism in p53 may influence individual responsiveness to cancer therapy."

Both genes are downregulated in 9 of 9 RCC cell lines. While the NORE1A promoter predominantly presents partial methylation in 6 of the cell lines and 17/53 (32%) primary tumors, the LSAMP promoter is completely methylated in 5 of 9 cell lines and in 14/53 (26%) sporadic and 4 familial CCRCCs. Expression of LSAMP and NORE1A proteins in CCRCC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation. These characteristics indicate that LSAMP and NORE1A may represent new candidate tumor suppressors for CCRCC."

        "abstract": "Tyrosine kinases are aberrantly activated in numerous malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify tyrosine kinases activated in AML, we developed a screening strategy that rapidly identifies tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using mass spectrometry. This allowed the identification of an activating mutation (A572V) in the JAK3 pseudokinase domain in the acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) cell line CMK. Subsequent analysis identified two additional JAK3 alleles, V722I and P132T, in AMKL patients. JAK3A572V, JAK3V722I, and JAK3P132T each transform Ba/F3 cells to factor-independent growth, and JAK3A572V confers features of megakaryoblastic leukemia in a murine model. These findings illustrate the biological importance of gain-of-function JAK3 mutations in leukemogenesis and demonstrate the utility of proteomic approaches to identifying clinically relevant mutations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether BCR/ABL expression directly causes blast crisis, and if so by what mechanism, is unknown. We have found that BCR/ABL translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after genotoxic stress. Furthermore, BCR/ABL increases DNA double-strand damage after etoposide treatment and leads to a defect in an intra-S phase checkpoint, causing a radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS) phenotype. In the nucleus, BCR/ABL associates with the ataxia-telangiectasia and rad 3-related protein (ATR) and disrupts ATR-dependent signal transduction. Overexpression of ATR in a BCR/ABL-expressing cell line corrects the DNA damage phenotype. These results demonstrate a nuclear role for BCR/ABL in altering the cellular response to DNA damage."

        "abstract": "Senescence, perceived as a cancer barrier, is paradoxically associated with inflammation, which promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we characterize a distinct low-grade inflammatory process in stressed epithelium that is related to para-inflammation; this process either represses or promotes tumorigenesis, depending on p53 activity. Csnk1a1 (CKI\u03b1) downregulation induces a senescence-associated inflammatory response (SIR) with growth arrest in colorectal tumors, which loses its growth control capacity in the absence of p53 and instead, accelerates growth and invasiveness. Corresponding processes occur in CKI\u03b1-deleted intestinal organoids, assuming tumorigenic transformation properties exvivo, upon p53 loss. Treatment of organoids and mice with anti-inflammatory agents suppresses the SIR and prevents p53-deficient organoid transformation and mouse carcinogenesis. SIR/para-inflammation suppression may therefore constitute a key mechanism in the anticarcinogenic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc."

        "abstract": "Genetic and epigenetic defects in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling play important roles in colorectal cancer progression. Here we identify DACT3, a member of the DACT (Dpr/Frodo) gene family, as a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that is transcriptionally repressed in colorectal cancer. Unlike other Wnt signaling inhibitors that are silenced by DNA methylation, DACT3 repression is associated with bivalent histone modifications. Remarkably, DACT3 expression can be robustly derepressed by a pharmacological combination that simultaneously targets both histone methylation and deacetylation, leading to strong inhibition of Dishevelled (Dvl)-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and massive apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. Our study identifies DACT3 as an important regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer and suggests a potential strategy for therapeutic control of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer."

        "abstract": "Purpose A factor pertinent to the design of cancer chemotherapy is multidrug resistance. Research in this area conventionally involves in vitro models using resistant cell lines generated by continuous low dose drug exposure for many months, unlike the exposure experienced by residual superficial bladder cancer cells during chemotherapy adjuvant to resection. Recently we noted a measure of multidrug resistance induced by 3 short exposures to mitomycin C during 10 weeks. We currently report detectable functional resistance after a single 1-hour insult. Materials and Methods {RT112} bladder cancer cells (Catalog No. {ACC} 418, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were exposed to a range of mitomycin C concentrations for 1 hour. Cells regrew in 3 of 24 cultures at 15.6, 3.91 and 0.98 mg/ml exposure. These cells were subjected to 3 functional tests of cross resistance to epirubicin, including {MTT} cytotoxicity assay, quantitative accumulation by flow cytometry and nuclear uptake or exclusion by live cell fluorescence microscopy. Results {MTT} assay and flow cytometry revealed clear indications of resistance. Intracellular distribution, in which nuclear exclusion indicates resistance, was distinctively resistant in 1 subline and another 2 were equivocal. Conclusions Results indicate that some multidrug resistance potential exists even in a cloned cell line that is capable of surviving 1 short drug exposure and expanding after that insult. The exposures used are consistent with those probably experienced by many superficial transitional cell carcinoma cells during an intravesical chemotherapy application. The result gives added weight to considering multidrug resistance induction in dose scheduling or drug combinations for topical chemotherapy. "

MRI of human oligodendroglioma also suggested a white matter (WM) origin, with markers for OPCs rather than NSCs similarly enriching for tumor formation.

Compared to normal cells, several human cancers have high mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and low expression of the K+ channel Kv1.5, both contributing to apoptosis resistance. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), shifts metabolism from glycolysis to glucose oxidation, decreases \u0394\u03a8m, increases mitochondrial H2O2, and activates Kv channels in all cancer, but not normal, cells; DCA upregulates Kv1.5 by an NFAT1-dependent mechanism. DCA induces apoptosis, decreases proliferation, and inhibits tumor growth, without apparent toxicity. Molecular inhibition of PDK2 by siRNA mimics DCA. The mitochondria-NFAT-Kv axis and PDK are important therapeutic targets in cancer; the orally available DCA is a promising selective anticancer agent. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Many studies have reported the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of artemisinins; however, there are no studies that compare such effects between cancer cell lines and normal human cells after treatment with artemether, an artemisinin derivative. Gastric cancer is the fourth most frequent type of cancer and the second highest cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro genotoxic and cytotoxic effects induced by artemether in gastric cancer cell line (PG100) and compare them with the results obtained in human lymphocytes exposed to the same conditions. We used MTT (3-(4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay, comet assay and ethidium bromide/acridine orange viability staining to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of artemether in PG100. MTT assay showed a decrease in the survival percentages for both cell types treated with different concentrations of artemether (P < 0.05). PG100 also showed a significant dose-dependent increase in DNA damage index at concentrations of 119.4 and 238.8 \u03bcg ml(-1) (P < 0.05). Our results showed that artemether induced necrosis in PG100 at concentrations of 238.8 and 477.6 \u03bcg ml(-1), for all the tested harvest times (P < 0.05). In lymphocytes, artemether induced both apoptosis and necrosis at concentrations of 238.8 and 477.6 \u03bcg ml(-1), for all the tested harvest times (P < 0.05). In conclusion, human lymphocytes were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the antimalarial drug than the gastric cancer cell line PG100.[on SciFinder (R)]"

METHODOLOGY: Human gastric cancer cell line MKN45 were plated in stem cell conditioned culture system allowed for spheroid body forming. The expression levels of CD44 and ABCG2 in the spheroid body cells were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining, and the tumorigenicity of the spheroid body-forming cells were assessed by in vivo xenograft studies in nude mice. RESULTS: The MKN45 cells could form spheroid bodies cultured in stem cell conditioned medium. The spheroid body-forming cells showed a significantly greater (p <0.05) expression of CD44 and ABCG2 than the parental cells. CONCLUSIONS: Spheroid body cells from gastric cancer cell line MKN45 cultured in stem cell conditioned medium possessed gastric CSC properties. The cells co-expressed of CD44 and ABCG2 might represent a subpopulation of gastric CSCs."
